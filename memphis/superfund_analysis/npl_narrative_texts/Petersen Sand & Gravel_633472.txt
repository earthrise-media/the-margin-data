NPL Site Narrative for Petersen Sand &
Gravel
 
PETERSEN SAND & GRAVEL
Libertyville, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Petersen Sand & Gravel operated a 1,000-acre quarry in
Libertyville, Lake County, Illinois, from 1952 to 1958. The Lake County Forest Preserve District acquired
the site in 1978 and planned to convert the quarry into a 170-acre recreational lake.
 
Several hundred drums of paints, solvents, and other industrial wastes were dumped into the quarry while
it was owned by Petersen Sand. In 1977, the company removed 400 drums from the quarry. In 1983,
the Lake County Forest Preserve District removed about 65 more drums. It is likely that some drums and
contaminated soil still remain in the quarry.
 
The State and EPA detected volatile organic chemicals and heavy metals in wells that are used by about
15,000 nearby residents as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency have signed a cooperative
agreement for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. EPA has approved a statement of work. After the
State selects a contractor, work will get underway.
 
Status (February 11, 1991) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Illinois, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
