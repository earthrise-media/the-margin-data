NPL Site Narrative for Luminous
Processes, Inc.
 
LUMINOUS PROCESSES, INC.
Athens, Georgia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 23, 1981) : Luminous Processes, Inc., is an abandoned manufacturing
facility located approximately 4 miles west of downtown Athens, Georgia, on U.S. Highway 78/29. Between
1952 and 1978, the company used radioactive material in the production of luminous watch and clock
dials.
 
The building and surrounding grounds, including adjacent property, are contaminated with radium-226
and tritium in excess of generally accepted permissible levels of radiation or radioactive materials in
unrestricted or noncontrolled areas. There is a potential for additional spread of contamination through
leaching and erosion by water and wind. The site is in a high growth area; the adjacent property consists of
commercial business firms and residences.
 
On April 20, 1981, the State filed suit in Superior Court against the defunct company, Luminous Processes.
The governor has requested assistance from EPA.
 
Status (December 30, 1982) : This site was on the Interim Priorities List, announced October 23, 1981
before formal rulemaking began in the Federal Register. This site is being deleted from the NPL because
EPA, in consultation with the State of Georgia, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed
response under CERCLA has been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is
appropriate.
