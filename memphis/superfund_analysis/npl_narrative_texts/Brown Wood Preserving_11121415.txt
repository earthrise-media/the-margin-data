NPL Site Narrative for Brown Wood
Preserving
 
BROWN WOOD PRESERVING
Live Oak, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Brown Wood Preserving Site, now abandoned, covers
29 acres in Live Oak, Florida. From 1946 until 1977, wood was treated on-site with creosote and
pentachlorophenol. Waste water was stored on-site in a 5-acre surface impoundment, which contains an
estimated 25,000 cubic yards of phenolic wastes. Soil in a ditch leading from the treatment/storage area is
contaminated with creosote wastes. The site is surrounded by residences using private wells and appears
to be in a sinkhole that may have a hydraulic connection to the deeper aquifer.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA collected samples early in 1983 to assess ground water conditions in the area
and found excessive levels of organic compounds associated with creosote and pentachlorophenol
treatment of wood products. Further action awaits release of the final report on the site.
