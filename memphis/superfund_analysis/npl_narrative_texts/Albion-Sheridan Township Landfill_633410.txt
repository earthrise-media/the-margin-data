NPL Site Narrative for Albion-Sheridan
Township Landfill
 
ALBION-SHERIDAN TOWNSHIP LANDFILL
Albion, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Albion-Sheridan Township Landfill covers 30 acres 1 mile east
of Albion, Calhoun County, Michigan. During 1966, the privately owned landfill accepted municipal refuse
and industrial wastes from Albion and nearby Sheridan Township. According to the owner, the landfill
accepted 200-300 cubic yards of sludges from a Union Steel Products plant prior to November 1981.
Tests conducted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in 1980 indicated that the sludges
contain chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, nickel, and cyanide. Paint residues were also accepted from an
unknown source.
 
In an inspection in March 1986, EPA found approximately 40 drums on the surface, some filled with what
appeared to be oil and grease wastes. The landfill was covered with sand and gravel, and there were signs
of burning. Some vegetation had grown on the cover.
 
The landfill was unlined. Soils are permeable and ground water shallow (10 feet). These conditions
facilitate movement of contaminants into ground water. An estimated 13,500 people obtain drinking water
from public and private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
The site is unfenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact with hazardous
substances.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
