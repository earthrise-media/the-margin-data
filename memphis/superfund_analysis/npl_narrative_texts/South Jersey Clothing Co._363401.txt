NPL Site Narrative for South Jersey
Clothing Co.
 
SOUTH JERSEY CLOTHING CO.
Minotola, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The South Jersey Clothing Co. site is in a mixed residential,
commercial, and light industrial area in the Minotola section of Buena Borough, Atlantic County, New
Jersey. The surrounding area is predominantly rural and one of New Jersey's prime agricultural regions.
Since the 1940s, the company has manufactured clothing on Central Avenue 500 feet from Garden State
Cleaners Co., which is also proposed for the NPL at this time.
 
In 1981, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) inspectors observed a black liquid
on the soil behind the South Jersey Clothing Co. building. Subsequent analysis revealed trichloroethylene
concentrations as high as 940,000 parts per billion (ppb) in soil and 16,000 ppb in a private drinking water
well.
 
Off-site monitoring wells downgradient of South Jersey Clothing and Garden State Cleaners contain up to
78,000 ppb of trichloroethylene and 6,600 ppb of tetrachloroethylene, according to analyses conducted in
1984 by the companies. These concentrations have forced closing of private wells and construction of a
new municipal water supply system. Approximately 9,000 people obtain drinking water and 3,800 acres of
farmland are irrigated from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
In 1984, South Jersey Clothing signed an Administrative Consent Order with NJDEP requiring the
company to intensify monitoring and take measures to restrict migration of contaminants in ground water.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is currently preparing a workplan for a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action.
