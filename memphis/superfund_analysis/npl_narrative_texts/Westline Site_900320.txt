NPL Site Narrative for Westline Site
 
WESTLINE SITE
Westline, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Westline Site covers about 40 acres in Westline, McKeon
County, Pennsylvania. The privately owned site consists of a series of abandoned lagoons once used to
hold sludge and other residues from a wood chemical plant that operated from the late 1800s to 1952. The
lagoons have contaminated local ground water with phenol and other organic compounds. Low levels of
organic compounds have also been identified in nearby Kinzua Creek.
 
Status (July 1983) : After an investigation by EPA, the present owners of the properties on which the
lagoons are located fenced the lagoons to prevent direct contact with the wastes. EPA is preparing a
Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup
required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
