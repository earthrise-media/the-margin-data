NPL Site Narrative for Koppers Coke
 
KOPPERS COKE
St. Paul, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The former Koppers Coke Site covers about 45 acres in the Midway
Industrial Park in St. Paul, Minnesota. From 1911 to 1979, Koppers operated a facility that converted coal
to coke and produced such by-products as coal tars and coal tar distillates. The company has dismantled
and removed all equipment from the site and completed an intensive on-site investigation. It revealed
that wastes discharged to the ground in unlined earthen pits and disposed of on the surface contaminate
soil and ground water with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, thiocyanate, ammonia, sulfates, phenols,
oil, and grease. Based on information currently available, the contamination does not threaten St. Paul's
municipal water supply, which comes from the Mississippi River north of Minneapolis.
 
Status (July 1983) : In cooperation with the State, Koppers has been working to remove coal tar wastes
and contaminated soil from the property. Thus far, Koppers has excavated and shipped 17,500 cubic yards
of material to a secure disposal site in Illinois. The surface cleanup has been completed, and Koppers has
sold the property to the St. Paul Port Authority, which intends to make it available to developers of the St.
Paul Energy Park.
 
EPA and the State are investigating migration of contamination from the site.
