NPL Site Narrative for Asbestos Dump
 
ASBESTOS DUMP
Millington, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Asbestos Dump covers 12 acres adjacent to the Passaic
River in Millington, New Jersey. The Asbestos Hill is the result of years of dumping by several asbestos
processing companies. In the 1950s, National Gypsum Co. acquired the site. Before closing the plant
in 1975, National Gypsum had the dump covered with soil and seeded. The property was later sold to
TIFA, Ltd., a manufacturer of pesticide-distributing equipment. At times erosion and weathering have
exposed small areas of asbestos along the river bank. National Gypsum has an agreement with TIFA and
the State to maintain the dump and stabilize the river bank. Recently, allegations have been made that
phenylmercuric acetate had been disposed of in the dump.
 
Status (July 1983) : Recently, National Gypsum restabilized the river bank, correcting erosion that took
place during heavy spring rains. EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
