NPL Site Narrative for Osborne Landfill
 
OSBORNE LANDFILL
Grove City, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Osborne Landfill covers 15 acres about 0.5 mile east
of Grove City in Pine Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania. In the 1950s, the privately owned
landfill accepted various types of industrial wastes. In 1978, the State closed the landfill for accepting
industrial wastes without a permit. EPA and the State found elevated levels of a wide range of hazardous
substances (including lead, arsenic, cadmium, benzene, benzo(a)pyrene, and benzo(b)fluoran) in the soil
and surface water at and near the site. An adjacent swamp, which drains to a fishing stream, Swamp Run,
is also contaminated. Another concern is the potential for contamination of ground water, which supplies all
drinking water in the area.
 
Status (July 1983) : As a result of negotiations with EPA and the State, Cooper Industries, Inc., which is
responsible for some wastes at the site, is voluntarily fencing the site, as well as removing surface drums,
other containers, and contaminated soil.
 
EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine
the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
