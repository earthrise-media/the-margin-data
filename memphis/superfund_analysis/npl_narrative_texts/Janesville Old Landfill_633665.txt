NPL Site Narrative for Janesville Old
Landfill
 
JANESVILLE OLD LANDFILL
Janesville, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The old Janesville Landfill in Janesville, Wisconsin, was
owned and operated by the city. From 1950 to 1978, the site, a 40-acre unlined gravel pit, accepted both
municipal and industrial wastes. Prior to 1974, the site received some General Motors (GM) wastes (paints,
petrochemicals, solvents, etc.), although it appears that most GM wastes went elsewhere. In 1974, when
Janesville started to operate an ash bed facility for disposal of industrial sludges, the site also received a
sludge-ash mixture generated when the ash beds were cleaned out. As much as 12 million gallons (60,000
cubic yards) of industrial sludges have been applied to the ash beds; the quantity of sludge-ash mixture
received at the landfill was smaller because of the water lost. Ground water under the site is contaminated
with chromium and lead, according to analyses conducted by the city.
 
In late 1978, the county constructed an 18.2-acre landfill, with a 5-foot clay liner and leachate collection
system, adjacent to the old landfill. It is still active.
 
Status (June 1984) : The site has been closed and capped, and ground water is being monitored. EPA has
initiated a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
