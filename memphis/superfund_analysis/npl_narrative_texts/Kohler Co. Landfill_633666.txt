NPL Site Narrative for Kohler Co. Landfill
 
KOHLER CO. LANDFILL
Kohler, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Kohler Co. Landfill in Kohler, Wisconsin, is within 300 feet
of the Sheboygan River. In August 1976, the State licensed 40 acres for disposal of industrial wastes.
Kohler also operates two 4-million-gallon lagoons west of the landfill. The lagoons reduce the total
suspended solids in the company's process waste water before it is discharged to the Sheboygan River.
 
In 1977 and in 1981, sludges (14,500 cubic yards and 21,413 cubic yards respectively) from the lagoons
were buried at the landfill. In addition, the landfill received foundry sand, municipal waste residues, oils,
and other wastes from the Kohler foundry.
 
Ground water at the landfill is apparently contaminated with chromium, cadmium, and phenols from past
landfilling operations, according to data collected by the State.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
