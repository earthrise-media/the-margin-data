Macomb Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The South Macomb Disposal Authority operated Landfills
#9 and 9A in Macomb Township, Macomb County, Michigan, from 1969 to 1974. The landfills, which
cover 153 acres, accepted general refuse and may have also received industrial wastes. The site is not
adequately covered, lined, or fenced. Leachate seeps are visible.
 
Two residential wells in the area have been contaminated with zinc and perhaps other metals and toxic
organic chemicals (including methyl ethyl ketone), according to analyses conducted by a consultant to the
authority. The landfills are the suspected source of the contamination.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
