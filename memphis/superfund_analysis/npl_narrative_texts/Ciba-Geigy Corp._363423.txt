NPL Site Narrative for Ciba-Geigy Corp.
 
CIBA-GEIGY CORP.
Toms River, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Ciba-Geigy Corp. operates the Toms River Chemical Plant
on a 1.5-square-mile site in Toms River, Ocean County, New Jersey. The plant is engaged in the batch
manufacture of a variety of synthetic organic dyes, pigments, and epoxy resins. Waste waters are treated
in a 7.5-million-gallon-per-day treatment plant and discharged under a Clean Water Act permit to the
Atlantic Ocean. Other wastes generated during the manufacturing process are disposed of in on-site
landfills. Within the property boundaries are inactive landfills that received large quantities of chemical
wastes over the past years. Of concern is the potential impact these materials may have on both public
and private wells in the surrounding area.
 
This site was once listed under the name "Toms River Chemical."
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the
full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
