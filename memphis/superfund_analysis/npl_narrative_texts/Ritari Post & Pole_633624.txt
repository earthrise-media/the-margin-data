NPL Site Narrative for Ritari Post & Pole
 
RITARI POST & POLE
Sebeka, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : The Ritari Post & Pole Site lies 3 miles northwest of Sebeka,
Wadena County, Minnesota. The 15-acre site has conducted wood-preserving operations since 1959,
using pentachlorophenol (PCP) as the preservative.
 
From 1959 to 1973, Ritari Post & Pole used a process that allowed liquid PCP to drip from treated wood
directly onto the ground. The owner estimates that 26,880 gallons of PCP dripped onto the ground during
that time. In addition, the operator applied an estimated 3,180 gallons of PCP-laden sludge directly to the
ground.
 
Analyses in 1982 by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and a consultant to Ritari show that a
monitoring well on the site and a private well less than 500 feet away are contaminated with PCP. The
private well has been replaced by a new well into a deeper uncontaminated aquifer. Ritari has taken no
cleanup actions. Approximately 350 people draw drinking water from the contaminated aquifer within 3
miles of the site; 400 acres of cropland are irrigated with the water.
 
The site is 0.75 mile upslope of a wetland area draining into Cat River. The river is used for recreational
activities. About 160 acres of cropland are irrigated with river water drawn from 2 miles downstream of the
site.
 
The site is only partially fenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact with
hazardous substances.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA's preliminary plan for fiscal year 1987 includes a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action.
