NPL Site Narrative for Carolawn, Inc.
 
CAROLAWN, INC.
Fort Lawn, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Carolawn, Inc., Site is an abandoned 3-acre waste storage
and disposal facility located near Fishing Creek, west of Fort Lawn, South Carolina. Several hundred
drums of chemical wastes (including acids, bases, organic solvents, and contaminated soil) were stored
both outside and inside the site, which is surrounded by a chain-link fence. Also on-site was a diked lagoon
filled with sludge. Heavy metals, phenols, and numerous volatile organic compounds have been detected.
A significant amount of contaminated run-off from the site has migrated into a tributary of the Catawba
River, which supplies drinking water for Lugaff. Air contamination affects the nearest homes, which are
located 100 yards from the site.
 
In late 1981 and early 1982, $600,000 in CERCLA emergency funds was approved to bulk and dispose
of all liquids in drums, remove remaining drums, and dispose of contaminated water from the lagoon.
However, ground water is contaminated, and on-site soil may also be.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. EPA is planning a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility
study to identify alternatives for remedial action.
