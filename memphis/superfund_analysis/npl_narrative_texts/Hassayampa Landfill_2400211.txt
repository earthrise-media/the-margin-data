Landfill
 
HASSAYAMPA LANDFILL
Hassayampa, Arizona
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Hassayampa Landfill covers 77 acres 40 miles west
of Phoenix, in Hassayampa, Maricopa County, Arizona. Since 1961, the county operated the landfill,
accepting municipal refuse. The county purchased the landfill in 1963. Between April 1979 and October
1980, the landfill was designated by the county as an interim disposal site for solid and liquid hazardous
waste.
 
On-site monitoring wells are contaminated with chlorinated organic solvents, including 1,1,1-trichloroethane
and trichloroethylene, according to tests conducted by the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS).
To date, contamination has not been detected in off-site wells. Approximately 350 people draw drinking
water from private wells within 3 miles of the site. About 2,800 acres of farmland are irrigated by wells
within 3 miles.
 
Hassayampa River, an intermittent stream, is 0.8 mile east of the landfill.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA has sent notice letters under Section 3007 of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act informing 108 individuals and companies of their potential responsibility for wastes
associated with the site. A remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action will be undertaken by the potentially
responsible parties, or by ADHS under a cooperative agreement with EPA.
