NPL Site Narrative for Ellis Property
 
ELLIS PROPERTY
Evesham Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Ellis Property covers 3 acres in Evesham Township, New
Jersey. The site, once the scene of drum-cycling operations, consists of: a large two-story building housing
several washing tanks and troughs and 50 to 75 drums, many full; three sheds containing various size
drums and chemical containers, which are full; and an area adjacent to the sheds containing about 100
55-gallon plastic drums, most of which still contain some acid liquid. Several hundred drums are spread
haphazardly around the site. Many spills are obvious.
 
The site is surrounded by cultivated fields. An intermittent stream named Sharps Run is less than 0.3
mile to the south. Ground water and surface water are suspected of being contaminated with acids. The
Englishtown Aquifer directly underlies the site, with the Magothy and Raritan Formations at about 320
feet below. Ground water in the vicinity supplies drinking water for 900 homes and water for irrigation of
farmland.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has removed all drums from the site and neutralized soils in the area with
lime. EPA is awaiting documentation from the State regarding the cleanup.
