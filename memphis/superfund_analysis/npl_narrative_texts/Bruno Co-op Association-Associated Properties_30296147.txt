BRUNO CO-OP ASSOCIATION/ASSOCIATED PROPERTIES
Bruno, Nebraska
 
 
Conditions at Proposal (October 1992) : The Bruno Co-op Association/Associated Properties site
involves two contaminated municipal wells in Bruno, Butler County, Nebraska. The area is used for
agricultural, commercial, and residential purposes. One well is at the intersection of Pine and Third Streets,
and one is 1,000 feet to the northwest. The second well is near Fremont Street on property that has been
the site of grain storage facilities since the 1940s. Sometime between 1968 and June 1988, the property
was divided into two businesses known as the Bruno Co-op Association and Wagner Mills, Inc. In June
1988, Bruno Co-op purchased the Wagner Mills property.
 
Originally, all of the property was owned by C&NW Railway Company. All or part of the property was
leased by a division of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) from 1947 to the 1960s for use as a
Federal grain storage facility. In 1964, all of the bins, except one corn crib bin, were sold to local farmers
and moved off site. The remaining bin was purchased by Bruno Co-op. Currently, Bruno Co-op has two
functional bins.
 
Tests conducted during 1986-88 by EPA and the Nebraska Department of Health (NDH) detected carbon
tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, and chloroform in the two wells. The three compounds had been poured
on or pumped into the grain to act as fumigants. An October 1988 soil-gas survey by EPA identified
elevated levels of carbon tetrachloride near the Fremont Street well and grain storage facilities.
 
From May 1989 to October 1990, when the Bruno Public Water Supply Company completed new wells,
EPA's removal program supplied bottled water to 150 Bruno residents.
 
In May 1988, EPA identified Bruno Co-op, USDA, and four parties that previously owned or leased portions
of contaminated property as responsible for wastes associated with the site.
 
Status (June 1996) : The USDA completed an expedited site characterization study in Bruno in December
1994. A remedial investigation-comparable report was published in May 1995. However, a draft interim
feasibility study, produced in September 1995, did not meet CERCLA requirements.
