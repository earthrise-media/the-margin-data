NPL Site Narrative for Cooper Road
 
COOPER ROAD
Voorhees Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 8, 1983) : The Cooper Road Site covers 85 acres in Voorhees
Township, New Jersey. It is the result of "midnight dumping" by unknown persons. An unknown quantity
of vials containing numerous hazardous substances, including hexachlorocyclopentadiene, 1,3-
dichlorobenzene, and other solvents, are visible, and many more are probably buried under sand. Several
private and municipal wells are within 500 feet of the site. The nearest surface water, North Branch River,
empties into the Delaware River. Ground water and surface water have not yet been sampled.
 
Status (September 21, 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
 
Status (February 22, 1989) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with the
State of New Jersey, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA
has been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
