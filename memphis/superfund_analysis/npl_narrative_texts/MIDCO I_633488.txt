NPL Site Narrative for MIDCO I
 
MIDCO I
Gary, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Midwest Solvent Recovery Co. (MIDCO) I Site occupies 4
acres in an area of wetlands in Gary, Indiana. In April 1975, the company began storing and reclaiming
thousands of drums of hazardous wastes on-site. The company apparently also dumped sludges and
other wastes into a pit on the site. In December 1976, a fire destroyed more than 14,000 drums, essentially
halting operations. In late 1977, operations started up again and stopped in 1979. Several thousand drums
containing materials such as paint sludges, solvents, acids, caustics, and cyanides were left on-site, many
of them leaking and deteriorated. The drums burned in the 1976 fire also remained. Surface water, ground
water, and soils are contaminated.
 
In June 1981, using $10,829 under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, EPA fenced the site. In February
1982, with $995,000 in CERCLA emergency funds, EPA removed the wastes and about 1 foot of soil
and placed a temporary clay cap on the site, thereby alleviating the threats of fire, explosion, and human
contact.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, has brought a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief
against parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with this site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently prepared a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
