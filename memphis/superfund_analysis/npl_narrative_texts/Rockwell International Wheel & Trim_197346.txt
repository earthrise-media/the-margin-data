NATIONAL  PRIORITIES  LIST  (NPL)  
***NPL Site*** September 2018 
ROCKWELL INTERNATION AL Grenada, Mississippi 
Grenada County WHEEL & TRIM 
Site Location: Rockwell International Wheel & Trim (alias Grenada Manufacturing) is located in north central Mississippi, on Highway 332 in Grenada. The site abuts Riverdale Creek, upstream from its confluence with the Yalobusha River. The surrounding area includes extensive wetlands and a mix of residential, agricultural and commercial uses. 
•Site History: Rockwell International Wheel & Trim, followed by Textron Automotive Company and Grenada Manufacturing, operated a wheel cover manufacturing and chrome plating facility from 1966 to the early 2000s. Historically, chrome plating sludge, solvent still bottoms, buffing compound and other wastes were disposed in a wetland near Riverdale Creek, a disposal area east of the facility, a sludge lagoon and into surface water via the outfall ditch. Spills of trichloroethylene (TCE) and toluene from above ground tanks are documented. The use of TCE ceased in 1992. The 40- acre site includes the plant, the former waste disposal areas (between the plant and Riverdale Creek) and the disposal area on Moose Lodge Road. The facility is currently a metal stamping operation (chrome plating has been discontinued). 
•Site Contamination/Contaminants: A ground water contaminant plume underlies the site and discharges to Riverdale Creek and nearby wetlands. TCE is present in ground water up to five orders of magnitude above the Safe Drinking Water Act Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). TCE has migrated from the subsurface into the air of the active manufacturing plant (217 employees) at level s above the risk-based benchmark levels for both sensitive and non- sensitive populations. Despite the existence of a permeable reactive barrier wall, TCE continues to enter the outfall ditch and Riverdale Creek at concentrations above the MCL. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and metals have contaminated nearby wetlands. 
•Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : TCE-contaminated ground water discharges to Riverdale Creek, a recreational fishery. TCE -contaminated ground water also underlies part of the adjacent residential area (84 homes) resulting in the potential for vapor intrusion in the future. Outdoor (ambient air) has intermittently shown TCE at or above the risk- based screening levels. 
•Response Activities (to date): In 2017, the facility increased ventilation to reduce plant worker exposure to TCE in the indoor air. In 2015, the state of Mississippi issued a water contact advisory for Riverdale Creek, a recreational fishery. Some contaminant source areas have been addressed under a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Corrective Action permit, including capping the former sludge lagoon and installation of a permeable reactive barrier wall. 
•Need for NPL Listing: The state of Mississippi referred the site to the EPA Super fund program because of the limited ability to address contamination beyond the scope of the RCRA permit and the complex nature of the ownership history. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from the state.  þ
