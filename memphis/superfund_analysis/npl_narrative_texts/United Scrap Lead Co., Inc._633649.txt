UNITED SCRAP LEAD CO., INC.
Troy, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The United Scrap Lead Co., Inc., Site covers 10 acres south
of Troy, Ohio. Between 1948 and 1980, the company reclaimed lead batteries, generating an estimated
32,000 cubic yards of crushed battery cases, which were used as fill material. The battery acid and rinse
water were disposed of in a 12-foot by 8-foot by 9-foot infiltration pit. State files suggest that 500 to 1,000
gallons per day of water containing 14.6 percent sulfuric acid and 20 to 100 milligrams per liter of lead were
discharged to the pit. Monitoring wells on-site are contaminated with lead, according to tests conducted by
the State. Two residential water wells contain lead above background levels but within the standards for
drinking water.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
