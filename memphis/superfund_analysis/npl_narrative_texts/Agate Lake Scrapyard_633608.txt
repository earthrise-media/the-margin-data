NPL Site Narrative for Agate Lake
Scrapyard
 
AGATE LAKE SCRAPYARD
Fairview Township, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Agate Lake Scrapyard covers about 2 acres in a rural
area in Fairview Township, Cass County, Minnesota. The area is used mostly for recreational activities.
The privately owned site operated from 1951 to 1983. The wastes of concern are solvents and waste oils
that could percolate to ground water and run off into surface water. Tests conducted by the State detected
PCBs and carbon tetrachloride in soil.
 
In January 1983, the Burlington Northern Railroad and the Crow Wing County Electrical Coop removed the
wastes for which they believed they were responsible. The State is planning further ground water and soil
sampling to determine the extent of the contamination.
 
About 1,100 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State is planning for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action.
