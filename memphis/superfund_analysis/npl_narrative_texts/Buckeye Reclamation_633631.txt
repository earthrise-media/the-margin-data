NPL Site Narrative for Buckeye
Reclamation
 
BUCKEYE RECLAMATION
St. Clairsville, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Buckeye Reclamation Site, a former strip mine, covers 50
acres near St. Clairsville, Belmont County, Ohio. It was licensed as a sanitary landfill but also accepted
industrial wastes, including sludges and liquids, without State approval. Industrial wastes were dumped into
permeable mining wastes. The slopes of the filled area are steep, and the mining wastes used for cover
are eroding. Substantial amounts of leachate from the rear of the site have entered a stream adjacent to a
private home. The site has polluted McHahon Creek, which may be used for recreational purposes. There
is potential to contaminate local wells.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
