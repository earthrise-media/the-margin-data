NPL Site Narrative for Boarhead Farms
 
BOARHEAD FARMS
Bridgeton Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Boarhead Farms Site covers 113 acres in Bridgeton
Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The site was used for horse breeding prior to 1970. A waste
salvaging and hauling business operated on the site under the name Boarhead Corp. until 1976, when
Keystone Excavation, a heavy equipment firm, began operating on the site.
 
Little is known about the quantities and types of waste that may have been deposited on-site; however,
three documented spills have occurred on the property: 2,500 gallons of ferric chloride in October 1973,
4,000 gallons of anhydrous ammonia in April 1976, and 1,000 gallons of sulfuric acid in September 1976.
After the last spill, the State of Pennsylvania issued an injunction forbidding any chemicals to be brought
onto the property.
 
In 1984, EPA detected elevated levels of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCEA), trichloroethylene, and zinc
in wells on the site. EPA also detected 1,1,1-TCEA and zinc in nearby residential wells. The 6,000 people
living in the area obtain drinking water from public and private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
The Delaware River is used for recreational activities within 3 miles downstream of the site.
 
The site is unfenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact with hazardous
substances.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is conducting a search to identify parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site and will then negotiate with them to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination and identify alternatives for remedial action.
