NPL Site Narrative for G&H Landfill
 
G&H LANDFILL
Utica, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The G & H Landfill covers 40 acres in Utica, Macomb County,
Michigan. From the late 1950s to 1966, millions of gallons of industrial wastes, including oils, solvents, and
process sludges, were dumped into pits and lagoons at the site. In response to a lawsuit filed by the State,
a Consent Order was entered in 1967. It required the company to stop disposal of all liquid wastes, but not
to clean up wastes already at the site. The site was operated as a refuse landfill from 1967 until it closed in
1974. EPA and the State have documented contamination of soil, surface water, and ground water in the
vicinity of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1982, EPA spent $6,902 in CERCLA emergency funds to fence an area
contaminated with high levels of PCBs.
 
EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine
the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
