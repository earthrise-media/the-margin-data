NPL Site Narrative for Pijak Farm
 
PIJAK FARM
Plumstead Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Pijak Farm Site occupies 5 acres in Plumstead Township,
Ocean County, New Jersey. The site, a working farm, is flat, dropping off into a marshy, wooded floodplain.
A corn field and two unnamed tributaries to Crosswicks Creek border the site. Between 1963 and 1970,
drums and free-flowing liquids were dumped into a natural ditch and then covered over. In 1980, the State
found that ground water was contaminated by organic chemicals. Initial analysis of the nearest private
wells showed no contamination.
 
The Pijak Farm, Friedman Property, Goose Farm, and Spence Farm (the so-called "Plumstead Sites") are
within a 2-mile radius.
 
Status (July 1983) : In September 1982, a $292,500 Cooperative Agreement was awarded to New Jersey
for a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action at the site. It is scheduled to be completed
in the third quarter of 1984.
