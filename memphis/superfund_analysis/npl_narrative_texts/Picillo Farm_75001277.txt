NPL Site Narrative for Picillo Farm
 
PICILLO FARM
Coventry, Rhode Island
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Picillo Farm Site covers 7.5 acres in Coventry, Rhode Island.
The area is sparsely populated. All nearby residences are served by private wells, and a large recreation
reservoir is about 1.5 miles east. The site was discovered in 1977 when several drums containing water-
reactive material exploded and started a fire. Subsequently, the State found four trenches filled with about
15,000 drums containing wastes, including solvents, oils, pesticides, PCBs, paint sludges, and explosives.
There is evidence of bulk discharge of liquid chemical wastes. Air, soil, ground water, and surface water
are contaminated.
 
In spring 1980, EPA began emergency removal of 10,000 buried drums from two trenches, using $560,000
provided under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act. In September 1981, EPA added $410,000 in CERCLA
emergency funds.
 
This is the top priority site in Rhode Island.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State completed the excavation and off-site disposal of all buried wastes
in mid-1982. Since 1979, the State has spent $1.5 million on the site. EPA's Office of Research and
Development spent $68,000 on a pilot study to detoxify PCBs in two large piles on-site. In February 1982,
EPA awarded a $4,938,570 Cooperative Agreement to Rhode Island to (1) excavate and dispose of drums
in two remaining trenches (completed in July 1982) and (2) do a remedial investigation and feasibility study
to identify alternatives for cleaning up contaminated soil and ground water (to be completed in the third
quarter of 1983). The next step, if approved, would be to select the cost-effective remedy and start design
activities.
 
The State has identified parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site, and litigation to
recover cleanup costs is pending against them and the site owner.
