NPL Site Narrative for Northside Landfill
 
NORTHSIDE LANDFILL
Spokane, Washington
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Northside Landfill covers 240 acres in Spokane,
Spokane County, Washington. Since 1930, the city has operated the landfill for disposal of municipal
wastes. Several nearby domestic water wells have been contaminated with organic solvents (including
tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, chloroform, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane), according to tests conducted
by the city and its consultant.
 
The landfill sits atop the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, designated by EPA as a sole source
aquifer under the Safe Drinking Water Act. It provides drinking water for the City of Spokane (population
170,000). The city has connected approximately 150 residents with contaminated wells to the municipal
water system.
 
The city is regularly monitoring on-site wells and a number of off-site wells to determine the location
and direction of flow of the plume of contaminated ground water. The city is also investigating remedial
measures to control the source of contamination.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The city has completed seven new monitoring wells and is assessing the data
collected. Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the Washington Department of Ecology is working
with the city to review and implement a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
