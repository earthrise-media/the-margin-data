NPL Site Narrative for American Chemical
Service, Inc.
 
AMERICAN CHEMICAL SERVICE, INC.
Griffith, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : American Chemical Service, Inc., recycled chemicals in Griffith,
Indiana, from 1958 to 1975, when it voluntarily stopped using two disposal areas on-site and covered them.
The State has responded to complaints about the company since 1972. The site contains buried drums
(estimated at 20,000) and sludges (primarily pigment and resins); the amounts, nature, and source are
unknown.
 
The shallow aquifer beneath the site is contaminated with pentachlorophenol, benzene, toluene, vinyl
chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethylene, and other organic compounds, according to analyses conducted for
the State. The majority of the 10,000 people residing within 3 miles of the site obtain drinking water from
the lower aquifer. No contamination of drinking wells has been documented to date. The aquifers are
separated by a supposedly continuous 15- to 25-foot layer of clay. The site is entirely mantled by sandy
soil with high permeability. Ground water flows primarily to the northwest.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA has completed a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes associated
with the site.
