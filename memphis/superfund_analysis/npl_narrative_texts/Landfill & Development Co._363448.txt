NPL Site Narrative for Landfill &
Development Co.
 
LANDFILL & DEVELOPMENT CO.
Mount Holly, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Landfill & Development Co. operates a 210-acre landfill in Mount
Holly, New Jersey. It is adjacent to Rancocas Creek and surrounded by residential developments. The
site, originally a sand and gravel pit, accepts municipal refuse, industrial and commercial solid waste,
and treated sewage sludge. It may have accepted hazardous substances in the past. The local health
department has documented that monitoring wells and some private wells are contaminated with volatile
organic chemicals.
 
In September 1977, the State issued an Administrative Order requiring the company to replace the private
wells, install a liner at the landfill, and pump and treat contaminated ground water. The pumping, which is
currently underway, involves 15 wells downgradient of the landfill. The water from these wells is aerated
and sprayed over a 5-acre wooded area on the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State is involved in an administrative hearing process to force the facility to
obtain a new and revised registration.
