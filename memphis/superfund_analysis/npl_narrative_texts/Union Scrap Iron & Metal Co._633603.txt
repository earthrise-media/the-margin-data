UNION SCRAP IRON & METAL CO.
Minneapolis, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Union Scrap Iron & Metal Co. sorted and crushed lead battery
fragments on a 1-acre site in Minneapolis, Minnesota, from 1973 through 1980. Lead was separated and
sold for recycling. The plastic and rubber fragments remaining, which also contain lead, accumulated in
piles, which are partially covered with tarpaulins. Presently, an estimated 30,000 tons of these fragments
are on the site. According to the State, airborne lead levels adjacent to the site significantly exceed
background levels. There is also potential for ground water and surface water contamination.
 
In a Stipulation Agreement signed with the State on Aug. 22, 1983, Union Scrap agreed to remove the
piles by December 1984 and conduct a soil contamination study.
 
Status (June 1984) : Union Scrap submitted plans for removal of the piles and for the soil contamination
study. The plastic and rubber fragments will be sieved to remove lead fragments, which will be recycled at
Poly Metals, Inc., in St. Paul, Minnesota. The sieved plastic will be sold for recycling. The rubber fragments
will be used as an additive in asphalt paving material.
