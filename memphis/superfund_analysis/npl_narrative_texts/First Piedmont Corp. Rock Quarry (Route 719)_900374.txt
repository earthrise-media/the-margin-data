NPL Site Narrative for First Piedmont
Corp. Rock Quarry (Route 719)
 
FIRST PIEDMONT CORP. ROCK QUARRY (ROUTE 719)
Pittsylvania County, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : The First Piedmont Corp. Rock Quarry (Route 719) Site covers
2-4 acres on Route 719 next to the town of Beaver Park, Pittsylvania County, Virginia. The site is on a
wooded hill that slopes toward Lawless Creek, which is used for recreational fishing.
 
This site was originally proposed for listing under the name "First Piedmont Corp. Rock Quarry."
 
First Piedmont Corp. leased the quarry from a private landowner in March 1970. Between April 1970 and
July 1972, the company disposed of 15,000 gallons of liquid waste consisting of solvents, water, carbon
black, and detergent into the quarry. This waste was generated by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., according
to information provided to EPA by First Piedmont Corp. under Section 103(c) of CERCLA. In addition,
Corning Glass has informed EPA that it disposed of scrap-glass containing elevated lead levels on the site.
Disposal operations were approved by the Pittsylvania County Health Department. In 1972, following a fire
on the site, the Virginia State Health Department ordered the site to close.
 
Buried wastes have the potential to migrate into ground water within 3 miles of the site that provides
drinking water to an estimated 1,700 people.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA's preliminary plan for fiscal year 1987 includes a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action.
