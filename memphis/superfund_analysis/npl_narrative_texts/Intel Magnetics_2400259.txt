NPL Site Narrative for Intel Magnetics
 
INTEL MAGNETICS
Santa Clara, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Intel Magnetics produces and tests magnetic products
and bubble memories at a plant in Santa Clara, Santa Clara County, California. The facility occupies
approximately 1 acre and is surrounded by industrial and business areas.
 
Monitoring wells on the site are contaminated with 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichlorofluoromethane, 1,1-
dichloroethylene, and trichloroethylene, according to analyses conducted by a consultant to Intel.
Contamination is believed to have resulted from leaking tanks. About 300,000 people depend on wells
within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Intel is working with the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB) to determine the
extent of contamination of ground water and soils.
 
This is one of 19 sites in the South Bay Area of San Francisco. Facilities at these sites have used a variety
of toxic chemicals, primarily chlorinated organic solvents, which contaminate a common ground water
basin. Although these sites are listed separately, EPA intends to apply an area-wide approach to the
problem as well as take specific action as necessary.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The company has installed a system to pump and treat contaminated ground
water. CRWQCB, in conjunction with EPA and the California Department of Health Services, is overseeing
response actions at the site.
