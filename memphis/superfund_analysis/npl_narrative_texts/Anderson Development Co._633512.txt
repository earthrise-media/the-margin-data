NPL Site Narrative for Anderson
Development Co.
 
ANDERSON DEVELOPMENT CO.
Adrian, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Anderson Development Co. (ADC) Site covers 10 acres
in Adrian, Michigan. From 1971 to March 1979, ADC manufactured a chemical curing agent under the
name Curene 442. The chemical, 4,4'-methylene-bis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA), is a carcinogen. In 1973,
anilines were found in the East Side Drain, where ADC discharged waste waters to the South Branch of
the Raisin River. Later that year, ADC began discharging to the Adrian municipal waste water treatment
plant, decreasing the plant's efficiency. MBOCA was detected in sewage sludge and in sediments from a
treatment lagoon. Studies conducted throughout 1979 also found MBOCA widely distributed in soils within
2 miles of the plant, and in the urine of ADC workers and preschool children living near ADC.
 
The State paved streets adjacent to the ADC industrial zone, cleaned 253 households, and removed or
tilled and covered contaminated soils in the industrial and residential areas.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through a State enforcement
action against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
