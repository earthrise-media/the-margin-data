NPL Site Narrative for RCA Del Caribe
 
RCA DEL CARIBE
Barceloneta, Puerto Rico
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : RCA Del Caribe manufactures masks for television screens on
an approximately 20-acre site in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. This process generates wastes containing
chromium, selenium, and iron. They were discharged into four holding lagoons. Limestone formations
below the site are highly susceptible to development of sinkholes. The sinkholes resulted in discharge
of the contents of two lagoons into ground water. Sampling of lagoon sediments detected significant
concentrations of chromium and selenium. Limited sampling of a public water well immediately
downgradient of the site shows no contaminants that would be attributed to the site. Other public supply
wells serving a population of 12,000 people are located within 1.5 miles of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is working with the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board and RCA to clean
up the site.
