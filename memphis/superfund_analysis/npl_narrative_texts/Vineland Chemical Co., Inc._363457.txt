NPL Site Narrative for Vineland Chemical
Co., Inc.
 
VINELAND CHEMICAL CO., INC.
Vineland, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Vineland Chemical Co., Inc., has manufactured arsenic-
based herbicides since before 1966 on 26 acres in suburban Vineland, Cumberland County, New Jersey.
Prior to 1977, the company stored byproduct arsenic salts in open piles and chicken coops. As a result,
contaminated ground water and run-off have entered the Blackwater Branch of the Maurice River,
according to the State. The area is highly dependent upon ground water for drinking supplies.
 
In 1979, the company, under a State Administrative Order, began operating a ground water
decontamination system and currently recycles all its process water in a closed system. Under an
Administrative Consent Order in December 1981, the company maintains an 11-well ground water
monitoring system. However, the decontamination system can treat only 25,000 to 35,000 gallons of
ground water per day, while an estimated 600,000 gallons leave the site daily.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
