NPL Site Narrative for Shenandoah
Stables
 
SHENANDOAH STABLES
Moscow Mills, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Shenandoah Stables Site covers about 7 acres near
Moscow Mills, Lincoln County, Missouri. In May 1971, the horse arena became contaminated with dioxin
when a St. Louis waste oil hauler sprayed approximately 2,000 gallons of contaminated oil for dust control.
Afterward, numerous birds, rodents, and over 40 horses died. Several adults and children became ill. In
August 1971, the top 6 to 8 inches of contaminated soil were excavated and used as fill material in a new
highway. In April 1972, more soil was removed from the arena and placed in a swampy area on-site. EPA
sampling in May and June 1982 indicated that the top 30 inches of soil in the arena contains from 1 to 127
parts per billion of dioxin.
 
This site was originally listed under the name "Arena 1: Shenandoah Stables."
 
Status (July 1983) : In May 1983, EPA entered into a Consent Order under CERCLA Section 106 requiring
the owner of the property to limit public access to the contaminated areas until such time as cleanup
measures are taken.
