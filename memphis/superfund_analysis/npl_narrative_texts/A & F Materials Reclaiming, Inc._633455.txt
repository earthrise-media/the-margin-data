NPL Site Narrative for A & F Materials
Reclaiming, Inc.
 
A & F MATERIALS RECLAIMING, INC.
Greenup, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The A&F Materials Reclaiming, Inc., Site occupies 3.8 acres in
Greenup, Illinois. The City of Newton periodically withdraws drinking water from the Embarras River
downstream of the site. On-site are four lagoons which hold a mixture of waste oils, sludges, spent
caustics, spent acids, water, and other waste products containing PCBs. Similar products containing PCBs
are stored in 13 steel tanks on-site, some of which have leaked on several occasions. The site contains
about 1.4 million gallons of contaminated water, 16,000 gallons of contaminated oil, and 800,000 gallons of
contaminated sludge and soil.
 
Operations at the site began during 1977 and ended June 1980. They were originally intended to
reprocess waste oils and sludges. The storage lagoons were filled by March 1978 and began to overflow,
contaminating the environmental pathways leading to the Embarras River 1,300 feet away. PCBs have
been found in the lagoons, tanks, ditch, Embarras River, site soils, and ground water beneath the site.
Significant concentrations of other organic compounds and heavy metals have also been detected.
 
In mid-1980, using $240,000 made available under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, EPA lowered the
level of waste in the lagoons, in addition to diking, trenching, and removing wastes.
 
Status (July 1983) : In May and December 1982, and in March 1983, CERCLA emergency funds were
used to again lower the level in the lagoons, to reinforce the containment dikes, and to take measures to
permanently contain the wastes. The total cost was $190,000.
 
In June 1983, EPA awarded a $277,727 Cooperative Agreement to Illinois to conduct a remedial
investigation/feasibility study of contaminated ground water.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA and the State of Illinois, has brought a Federal civil action
seeking injunctive relief against parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with this site.
