NPL Site Narrative for Anaconda
Aluminum Co./Milgo Electronics Corp.
 
ANACONDA ALUMINUM CO./MILGO ELECTRONICS CORP.
Miami, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : The Anaconda Aluminum Co./Milgo Electronics Corp. Site
consists of two areas located directly across from each other on N.W. 76th Street in Miami, Dade County,
Florida. The site is in an industrialized area northeast of Miami International Airport.
 
The Anaconda Aluminum portion of the site covers approximately 1 acre at 3610 N.W. 76th Street.
Between May 1957 and February 1983, operations involved an electrochemical process using acids
and an aluminum-containing base to produce a protective coating on aluminum. Up to 1967, a chromic
acid process was employed. The Milgo Electronics portion of the site covers approximately 0.5 acre at
3601 N.W. 76th Street. Between 1961 and June 1984, operations involved chrome, nickel, and copper
electroplating of data processing equipment and the manufacturing of cabinets for electronic components.
Both companies disposed of liquid waste on-site. Anaconda Aluminum used soakage pits, while Milgo
Electronics used a drainfield.
 
In April 1987, EPA found chromium and lead in the Biscayne Aquifer, which EPA has designated as a sole
source aquifer under the Safe Drinking Water Act. At least four municipal well fields are within 3 miles of
the site: the Upper and Lower Miami Springs, the Hialeah, and the John E. Preston. An estimated 750,000
people obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
