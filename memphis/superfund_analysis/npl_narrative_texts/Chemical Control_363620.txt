NPL Site Narrative for Chemical Control
 
CHEMICAL CONTROL
Elizabeth, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Chemical Control Site is in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The
Elizabeth River borders the site on the west and Arthur Kill is about 200 feet east. The State, through
litigation, placed the company in receivership in January 1979, leaving on-site about 65,000 drums of
untreated hazardous chemical waste, two buildings used for the storage of chemicals and pesticides, and
seven storage tanks containing chemicals. The State worked on cleaning up the site until April 1980, when
there was a massive fire. Due to fire, the cleanup activities on site were accelerated.
 
Status (July 1983) : Cleanup activities continued to November 1981. The site is now a fenced-in gravel lot
with about 200 gas cylinders and 11 trailers awaiting disposal, and blocked storm sewers. A U.S. Coast
Guard report indicates several metallic objects are in the river adjacent to the site.
 
EPA plans to conduct additional studies and corrective actions at the site, under a Superfund State
Contract with New Jersey amounting to about $500,000.
 
The owner and a waste transporter were found guilty of criminal charges and are in jail.
