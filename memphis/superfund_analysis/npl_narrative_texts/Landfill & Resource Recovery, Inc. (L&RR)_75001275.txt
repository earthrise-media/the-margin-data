LANDFILL & RESOURCE RECOVERY, INC. (L&RR)
North Smithfield, Rhode Island
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Landfill & Resource Recovery, Inc. (L&RR) occupies 36 acres
in North Smithfield, Rhode Island. The area, originally a sand and gravel pit, has been used for refuse
disposal since 1927. In 1969, the site began accepting solid waste for disposal. This small-scale operation
was sold in 1974 to L&RR, which developed it into a large-scale facility accepting commercial, domestic,
and industrial wastes. Between 1978 and September 1979, from 0.5 million to 2.0 million gallons of
hazardous waste were accepted at the site. In December 1979, a plastic liner was placed over the
hazardous waste to protect it from precipitation.
 
The L&RR Site is located in a recharge area of an aquifer with the potential to be developed for municipal
drinking water. Ground water and the Slatersville Reservoir (both downgradient) are being used for
drinking water. The site is bisected by a tributary of Trout Brook that drains to the Slatersville Reservoir.
On-site and off-site monitoring wells show low levels of organic and metal contamination.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
