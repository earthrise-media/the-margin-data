NPL Site Narrative for Iron Horse Park
 
IRON HORSE PARK
Billerica, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Iron Horse Park is a 1,300-acre industrial park in Billerica,
Massachusetts, about 30 miles northwest of Boston. EPA is investigating five industries within the park and
two adjacent to it. The industries have historically disposed of their by-products, which include asbestos,
PCBs, and miscellaneous organic chemicals, in lagoons or landfills on their properties. The park is
located within the drainage basins of two rivers. A canal, stream, and wetlands are capable of carrying
contaminants into both river basins. Air pollution is also of concern because about 8,300 people live within
1 mile of the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is developing a scope of work for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
Preliminary sampling by EPA indicates that ground water and surrounding surface water contain a number
of pollutants, including asbestos, volatile organic chemicals, acids, and pesticides.
