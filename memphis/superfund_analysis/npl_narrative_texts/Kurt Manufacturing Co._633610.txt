NPL Site Narrative for Kurt Manufacturing
Co.
 
KURT MANUFACTURING CO.
Fridley, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Kurt Manufacturing Co. Site occupies about 10 acres
in Fridley, Anoka County, Minnesota, approximately 1 mile east of the Mississippi River. The site is in an
industrial, commercial, and residential area. Over 163,000 people live within 3 miles of the site. Since
1960, the company has manufactured precision computer components on the property.
 
Soil, monitoring wells, and a production well on-site are contaminated by tetrachloroethylene, cis-1,2-
dichloroethylene, and trichloroethylene, according to tests conducted by the State. The St. Peter
Sandstone, Jordan Sandstone, and other neighboring aquifers are not known to be contaminated at this
time. The source of contamination is believed to be a shavings bin collection pit beneath a loading dock on
the site.
 
On April 23, 1984, the State issued a Request for Response Action under Minnesota Superfund to Kurt
Manufacturing. The action requires the company to conduct a remedial investigation and a feasibility study,
as well as to develop a remedial action plan and implement it.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Kurt is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The final remedial
investigation report was approved in October 1985.
