NPL Site Narrative for Presque Isle
 
PRESQUE ISLE
Erie, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (December 30, 1982) : The Presque Isle Site is located in the City of Erie, Erie
County, Pennsylvania. In the early 1970s a foul-smelling, sulfur-laden, black liquid began discharging from
an abandoned gas well at Presque Isle State Park. The source of the discharge was a deep underground
formation, the Bass Island Formation. The color of the material and its composition indicated it was not
natural to the formation. The discharge released dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide into the air and
other hazardous substances into the soil. EPA is continuing to investigate the sources of contamination
in the Bass Island Formation. In the fall of 1982, the State plugged the Presque Isle well. EPA and the
U.S. Geological Survey are concerned that the same material could rise in additional abandoned wells and
contaminate ground water over a wide area.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : EPA is preparing a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine if materials similar to that discharged at the Presque Isle well can affect other wells, causing
environmental or public health problems that would require remedial action.
 
Status (February 13, 1989) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under
CERCLA has been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
