POLLUTION ABATEMENT SERVICES
Oswego, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Pollution Abatement Services (PAS), now bankrupt, operated a
liquid waste incineration facility just east of Oswego, New York, from 1970 through 1976, when it was
closed by the State. Remaining on the 15-acre site were toxic, flammable, and explosive wastes, including
off-specification polymer gels, plating wastes, metal sludges, paint wastes, and laboratory chemicals. The
wastes were in 15,000 drums, in lagoons, and in six surface and buried storage tanks. Ground water is
polluted, as is surface water, which discharges into Lake Ontario approximately 1 mile from Oswego's
drinking water intake.
 
Between 1977 and 1981, EPA, with $2.1 million made available under Section 311 of the Clean Water
Act, removed and disposed of oil and hazardous liquid wastes, including large quantities of materials
contaminated with PCBs.
 
This is the top priority site in New York.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1982, $100,000 in CERCLA emergency funds were approved to control
run-off, repack leaking drums, and erect a fence. Since July 1981, EPA has approved $3.4 million
(through a Cooperative Agreement and contracts) for removal of remaining surface wastes (completed in
December 1982) and a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action to clean up subsurface
contamination (scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983).
 
EPA plans to send Notice Letters to generators of wastes at the site asking them to participate in the
cleanup.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, has brought a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief
against PAS and its principals.
