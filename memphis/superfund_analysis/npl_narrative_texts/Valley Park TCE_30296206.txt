NPL Site Narrative for Valley Park TCE
 
VALLEY PARK TCE
Valley Park, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : The Valley Park TCE Site is in Valley Park, a densely populated
urban area of St. Louis County, Missouri. The site is underlain by a plume of contaminated ground water in
the Meramec River alluvial aquifer, which supplies water to about 36,000 people in the cities of Valley Park
and Kirkwood. In July 1982, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) and EPA detected
trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and a number of other volatile organic
chemicals in the city's drinking water. Follow-up sampling indicated all three city wells were contaminated.
 
Possible sources of contamination include the large number of industries located in Valley Park, railroad
spills which reportedly occurred years earlier, and discharges/dumping that may have occurred in the
vicinity of the site.
 
The city is studying methods of improving treatment of the contaminated water to reduce contaminant
levels. When the study is completed and funds are available, the city plans to install the necessary
treatment facilities.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : MDNR is developing the criteria for selection of eligible contractors to perform
work at the site. The contractor will develop a scope of work and complete the design study. This
preparation phase, including development of the criteria, requests for proposals, and selection of a
contractor, was due to be completed by the end of May 1986.
