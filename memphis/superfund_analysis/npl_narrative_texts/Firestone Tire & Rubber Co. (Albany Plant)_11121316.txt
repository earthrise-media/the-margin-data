NPL Site Narrative for Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. (Albany Plant)
 
FIRESTONE TIRE & RUBBER CO. (ALBANY PLANT)
Albany, Georgia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. has manufactured tires on a 329.2-
acre site in Albany, Dougherty County, Georgia, since 1968. Until 1980, drums of waste cement were
stored on the ground in an area of less than 1 acre. In another area, wastes were buried in a pit during fire-
training exercises.
 
In 1986, a consultant to the company detected benzene, 1,1-dichloroethylene, toluene, 1,1-dichloroethane,
1,1,1-trichloroethane, and zinc in on-site wells. An estimated 400 people obtain drinking water from private
wells within 3 miles of the site, and 1,000 acres of cropland are irrigated with well water.
 
This facility obtained Interim Status under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) when it filed a Notification of Hazardous Waste Activity and Part A of a permit application to treat,
store, or dispose of hazardous waste. Later, it withdrew its Part A and converted to generator-only status
with EPA or State approval. Hence, it satisfies a component of EPA's NPL/RCRA policy.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
