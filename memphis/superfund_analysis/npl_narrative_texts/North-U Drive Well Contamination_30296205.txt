NPL Site Narrative for North-U Drive Well
Contamination
 
NORTH-U DRIVE WELL CONTAMINATION
Springfield, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The North-U Drive Wells are north of Springfield, Greene
County, Missouri. In November 1983, the State received complaints that private drinking water wells on
North-U Drive were contaminated by organic chemicals. An initial investigation by the State indicated that
seven separate wells at five locations had chemical tastes and odors. Analysis of the well water detected
various combinations of volatile organic chemicals. The State undertook additional sampling in April 1984
to determine the areal extent of contamination, the levels of contamination, and the presence of any other
contaminants. The Greene County Civil Defense is trucking in water for about 20 households.
 
The site is located in an area of highly permeable formations. The contaminated wells are about 1,500 feet
west of Fulbright Spring, a major water source for the City of Springfield (population 133,000).
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA, in cooperation with Greene County and the Greene County Civil Defense,
used CERCLA emergency funds to extend a city waterline to the site, provide service connections to area
residences, and permanently plug many private wells in the contaminated area.
 
A multisite cooperative agreement between EPA and the State covering five sites, including North-U Drive
Well Contamination, was approved September 9, 1985. Initial funding is for planning activities.
