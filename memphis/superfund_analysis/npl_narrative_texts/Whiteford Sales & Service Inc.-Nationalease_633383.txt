NPL Site Narrative for Whiteford Sales &
Service Inc./NationaLease
 
WHITEFORD SALES & SERVICE INC./NATIONALEASE
South Bend, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Whiteford Sales and Service Inc./NationaLease Site covers
approximately 7 acres on Sample Street in South Bend, St. Joseph County, Indiana. The site operated as
Whiteford Sales and Service during 1960-83 and as NationaLease during 1983-87. Both companies leased
trucks and semitrailers. Currently, the operation is known as Whiteford-Kenworth, Inc.
 
Approximately 396,000 gallons of degreasing solvents and sludge resulting from cleaning of the trucks and
semitrailers were deposited into three unlined dry wells, each 4 feet in diameter and 6 feet deep. Tests
conducted by St. Joseph County in May 1985 found that on-site soil is contaminated with inorganic and
organic compounds, including lead, arsenic, ethylbenzene, and toluene. Soil on the site is permeable,
facilitating the movement of contaminants into ground water. Approximately 237,000 people draw drinking
water from public wells within 3 miles of the site. The nearest well is about 900 feet from the site.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : On June 19, 1987, Whiteford and the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management signed a Consent Decree requiring Whiteford to remove 4 feet of soil in all directions from
around the dry wells. Whiteford has not met this requirement. In June 1990, EPA is to start a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action.
