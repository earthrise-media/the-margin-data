NPL Site Narrative for Woodland Route
532 Dump
 
WOODLAND ROUTE 532 DUMP
Woodland Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Woodland Route 532 Dump covers about 35 acres of
relatively flat land in Woodland Township in rural Burlington County, New Jersey. In the early 1960s, the
owner accepted wastes from several chemical manufacturers for open burning, dumping, and burial of
drummed and bulk chemical wastes. This location came into use after complaints from nearby residents
forced abandonment of a nearly identical site along Route 72. On-site are several sludge mounds,
numerous sandy depressions containing drums, and a pond filled with thick oil. Sampling by the State
and EPA indicates heavy contamination with organic solvents, heavy metals, and suspected carcinogens.
These materials threaten ground water, surface water, and air, and show potential for harm through direct
contact.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
