NPL Site Narrative for Wildcat Landfill
 
WILDCAT LANDFILL
Dover, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Wildcat Landfill covers about 84 acres in a wetland area
adjacent to the St. Jones River in Dover, Delaware. The site was privately owned and operated as a
disposal facility for municipal and industrial waste until 1973, when it was closed for numerous permit
violations under the State's solid waste regulations. Wastes were dumped in wetland marshes and
frequently left uncovered. Various drums and solidified sludges are visible on the surface, and ground
water is contaminated with lead, cadmium, beryllium, arsenic, benzene, phthalates, and low levels of PCBs
(6 parts per billion).
 
Status (July 1983) : Negotiations are underway for a Superfund State Contract covering a remedial
investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study to identify
alternatives for remedial action.
