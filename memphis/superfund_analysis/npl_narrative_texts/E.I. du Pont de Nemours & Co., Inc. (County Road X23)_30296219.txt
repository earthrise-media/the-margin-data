NPL Site Narrative for E.I. du Pont de
Nemours & Co., Inc. (County Road X23)
 
E.I. DU PONT DE NEMOURS & CO., INC. (COUNTY ROAD X23)
West Point, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., Site consists of two
areas off County Road X23 in a rural area of Lee County approximately 3.5 miles southeast of West Point,
Iowa. In the early 1950s, Du Pont sent wastes from its nearby Fort Madison paint plant to the two areas,
which are about 1.25 miles apart and cover about 4 acres.
 
Du Pont estimates that it sent 12,000-18,000 55-gallon drums of waste annually to the site. Disposal
occurred from April 1949 to November 1953 at the first area, now owned by a private citizen, and on a
limited basis during November 1952-November 1953 at the second area, now owned by Du Pont. On both
areas, wastes were dumped into shallow trenches (each reportedly 75-100 feet long, 10-12 feet wide, and
3-4 feet deep) and periodically burned. The trenches have since been filled and the area graded. Ravines
are adjacent to the two disposal areas on the north-northwest sides.
 
EPA investigations in April 1987 detected lead in on-site wells. An estimated 1,200 people depend on
private wells within 3 miles of the site as their sole source of drinking water. Two creeks approximately 1
mile from the site are used for limited recreational activities.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : Under a Unilateral Administrative Order issued by EPA, Du Pont is conducting
a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action.
