NPL Site Narrative for Rochester Property
 
ROCHESTER PROPERTY
Travelers Rest, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Rochester Property covers about 2 acres in Travelers Rest,
a rural area in Greenville County, South Carolina. In 1971-72, the property owner permitted liquid industrial
wastes containing volatile organic chemicals and arsenic to be buried in four 10-foot-deep trenches in what
had been farmland.
 
The wastes came from Polymer Industries of Greenville, South Carolina, according to the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). During an inspection in September 1982, the
State observed wastes seeping out of the ground.
 
In November 1984, SCDHEC detected arsenic and volatile organic chemicals, including
trichlorofluoromethane, in on-site soils. Site soils are quite permeable. Thus, contaminants can move into
ground water, which occurs at depths of 10 feet and, within 3 miles of the site, is the source of drinking
water for about 1,000 people. All drinking water is from shallow private wells; no municipal supplies are
available.
 
The site is about 200 feet upgradient from a small stream.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : In June 1988, EPA detected several organic chemicals, including
pentachlorophenol, in soils on the site.
