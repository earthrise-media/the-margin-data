NPL Site Narrative for Sikes Disposal Pits
 
SIKES DISPOSAL PITS
Crosby, Texas
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Sikes Disposal Pits are located on a 40-acre site in Crosby,
Harris County, Texas, in the floodplain of the San Jacinto River. The entire area has flooded twice in
the recent past. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the site owner dumped unsegregated chemical
wastes from area petrochemical companies into four major pits. A large number of drums are on the site.
Chromium and various organic chemicals have been identified. A large area of sludge extends eastward
from the site and flows into the San Jacinto River bottom lands. Surface waters are contaminated, and
ground water is suspected of being contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : In June 1982, EPA awarded a $476,000 Cooperative Agreement to Texas for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site. In March 1983, EPA
entered into an interagency agreement with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and awarded
$30,000 to relocate the Sikes family. The relocation was completed in early May. In March 1983, EPA
added $19,078 to the Cooperative Agreement. The work is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter
of 1983. In June 1983, EPA used $36,164 in CERCLA emergency funds to remove sands and phenolic
wastes from the site.
