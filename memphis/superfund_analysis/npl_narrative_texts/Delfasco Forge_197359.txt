NATIONAL  PRIORITIES  LIST  (NPL)  
***NPL Site*** September 2018 
DELFASCO FORGE Grand Prairie, Texas 
Dallas County 
Site Location: The site is located in the city of Grand Prairie, a western suburb of Dallas, Texas. 
•Site History: The former Delfasco Forge facility operated as a munitions manufacturing and forge operation since the 1950s. The facility ceased operations in 1998. The source of contamination is the soil and groundwater contaminated with chlorinated solvents. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) program conducted a vapor intrusion investigation of the neighborhood in 2008, sampling sub- slabs, crawl spaces and indoor air in 16 homes and two commercial structures. Ten of the 18 structures had measurable levels of trichloroethylene (TCE) in indoor air. In July 2008, owners of Delfasco Forge filed for bankruptcy. In November 2008, mitigation systems were installed at the four homes with the highest TCE vapor concentrations under the Superfund Removal program. The EPA received money under the bankruptcy settlement to conduct vapor mitigation work. The EPA RCRA program used the bankruptcy funds to offer presumptive mitigation systems to approximately 80 residential homes located above the plume. Thirty-one of those residents accepted mitigation systems and the systems were installed in 2014. The EPA conducted pre- and post-mitigation sampling. 
•Site Contamination/Contaminants: The soil and groundwater are contaminated with tetrachloroethylene, TCE, cis -1,2-dichloroethene, trans-1,2- dichloroethene, 1,1-dichloroethene, and vinyl chloride. This subsurface contamination has resulted in indoor air contamination of the residential properties adjacent to the former facility. 
•Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : In 2009, the Texas Department of State Health Services and Texas Environmental Health Institute, in consultation with the EPA, ATSDR, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an exposure investigation of the area surrounding the former Delfasco facility. Groundwater, soil vapor, indoor air and biological tissue were tested for TCE and a correlation between levels of TCE in blood samples and indoor air was identi fied. There are potentially 74 residential and/or commercial structures overlying the subsurface contamination which may be affected. 
•Response Activities (to date): The Superfund removal program installed four vapor mitigation systems in 2008. An additional 31 homes received vapor mitigation systems in 2014 utilizing funds from the bankruptcy settlement. 
•Need for NPL Listing: The state of Texas referred the site to the EPA because no other viable options for long -term remediation were available. Delfasco Forge filed for bankruptcy and all resulting bankruptcy funds have been expended in responding to this site. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from the state.  þ
