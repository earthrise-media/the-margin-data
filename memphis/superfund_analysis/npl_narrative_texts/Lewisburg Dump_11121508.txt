NPL Site Narrative for Lewisburg Dump
 
LEWISBURG DUMP
Lewisburg, Tennessee
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Lewisburg Dump covers 20 acres in Lewisburg, Tennessee.
For 20 to 25 years until it officially closed in 1979, it was Lewisburg's municipal dump. It also accepted
industrial wastes, including inorganics and solvents. The dump partially filled a former limestone quarry that
contains a lagoon fed by ground water. There is a potential for ground water contamination. Run-off enters
an unnamed tributary to Big Rock Creek, but samples show no contamination to date.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is working with Lewisburg to control access to the site to eliminate illicit
dumping and provide for routine monitoring.
