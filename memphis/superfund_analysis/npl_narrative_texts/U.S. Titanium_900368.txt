NPL Site Narrative for U.S. Titanium
 
U.S. TITANIUM
Piney River, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The U.S. Titanium Site covers 80 acres near the village of
Piney River, Nelson County, Virginia. Between 1931 and 1971, a mine and ore-refining plant at the site
produced titanium dioxide for paint pigments. About 80,000 cubic yards of acidic wastes from the ore-
refining process were left at the site when the plant closed. Storm run-off from this waste caused several
large fish kills in the Piney River in the late 1970s. In 1980, the acidic wastes were removed from the
original exposed location and buried in a clay-lined cell. In summer 1982, the State completed a grading
and revegetation project at the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : Although the recent work has improved conditions at the site, acidic run-off still
threatens the Piney River. EPA recently completed a draft Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the
investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions
at the site.
 
The State is currently pursuing an enforcement action against the present and former owners of the site.
