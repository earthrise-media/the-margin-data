NPL Site Narrative for Elmore Waste
Disposal
 
ELMORE WASTE DISPOSAL
Greer, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Elmore Waste Disposal Site is an open field covering
approximately 0.5 acre in a residential area of Greer, Spartanburg County, South Carolina. According
to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC), drums containing
unknown liquid waste were deposited there in 1977. In response to citizen complaints of odors coming
from the site, SCDHEC inspected the site and found an estimated 150 55-gallon drums (some leaking)
and a 6,000-gallon buried tank. The liquid waste in the drums was reported to have come from the 1977
cleanup of the Jadco Hughes Facility in Belmont, North Carolina, which was placed on the NPL in June
1986.
 
In 1977, the owner of the Elmore site entered into a Consent Order with the State to clean up and properly
dispose of the waste. The owner attempted a partial cleanup, surrounding some of the leaking drums with
wood shavings, removing some of the deteriorated drums, and excavating and drumming some of the
contaminated surface soil.
 
EPA found several organic and inorganic compounds, including 1,1-dichloroethane, trans-1,2-
dichloroethylene, ethylbenzene, xylene, vinyl chloride, lead, and chromium, in on-site soil, sediment, and
surface water samples collected in August 1981 and June 1984.
 
In early 1986, SCDHEC started a removal action at the site and a program to monitor ground water. After
completing the removal in July 1986, SCDHEC shipped 5,477 tons of contaminated soil and debris, 2,000
gallons of contaminated liquid, and 299 drums to a hazardous waste facility regulated under Subtitle
C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Samples collected by SCDHEC in August 1986
and July 1987 from on-site monitoring wells contained tetrachloroethylene, 1,1,2-trichloroethane, and
trichloroethylene in concentrations above established drinking water standards. An estimated 1,350 people
obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Wards Creek, a small tributary to the South Tyger River, flows about 700 feet north of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
