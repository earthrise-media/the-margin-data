NPL Site Narrative for Kalama Specialty
Chemicals
 
KALAMA SPECIALTY CHEMICALS
Beaufort, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Kalama Specialty Chemicals Site covers about 16 acres
in a coastal environment in Beaufort, Beaufort County, South Carolina. The company is no longer in
business. Its primary product was Krinite, a herbicide. Wastes present on the site include methanol
bottoms, laboratory wastes, distillation bottoms, phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus trichloride,
xylene wastes, Krinite wastes, spent oil, and methyl methacrylate. On-site is a lagoon that at one time
overflowed into a tile field. In January 1979, an explosion of one of the reactors caused extensive spilling
of various organic chemicals. State data indicate that the explosion, as well as the tile field operation, has
contaminated shallow ground water with lead, benzene, ethyl benzene, and toluene. The site is in the
recharge zone of a primary aquifer. State analytical data also indicate surface water is contaminated with
the same chemicals. In January 1980, the State issued a Consent Order requiring the company to (1)
upgrade a treatment system on the site and (2) develop a plan to study ground water.
 
Status (June 1984) : In accordance with an amended Consent Order, the company has submitted a
proposal to the State for a study of ground water and soil contamination.
