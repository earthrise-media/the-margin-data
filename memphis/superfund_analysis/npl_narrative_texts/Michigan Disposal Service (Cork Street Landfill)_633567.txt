NPL Site Narrative for Michigan Disposal
Service (Cork Street Landfill)
 
MICHIGAN DISPOSAL SERVICE (CORK STREET LANDFILL)
Kalamazoo, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Michigan Disposal Service's Cork Street Landfill covers
approximately 64 acres in Kalamazoo, Kalamazoo County, Michigan. The city operated the site as a
general refuse landfill from 1925 until 1968. Until the mid-1960s, a teepee-type incinerator was on the site.
After closing the landfill for general refuse, the city operated it for inert material until 1981, when Michigan
Disposal Service (formerly Dispos-O-Waste) bought the site. The company has applied to the State for a
permit to operate a sanitary landfill.
 
Monitoring wells on the site contain lead and arsenic above drinking water standards, according to tests
conducted by the State. The City of Kalamazoo (population 80,000) has three well fields within 3 miles of
the site.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : Recent information indicates that only 46.2 acres of the site were used for
filling.
 
An Administrative Order under CERCLA Section 106 involving Michigan Disposal Service, the City of
Kalamazoo, and EPA became effective on December 3, 1987. The order calls for the city to conduct a
remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site
and identify alternatives for remedial action. The RI is underway.
