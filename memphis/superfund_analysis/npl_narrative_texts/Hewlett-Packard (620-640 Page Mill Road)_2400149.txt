NPL Site Narrative for Hewlett-Packard
(620-640 Page Mill Road)
 
HEWLETT-PACKARD (620-640 PAGE MILL ROAD)
Palo Alto, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Hewlett-Packard manufactured optoelectronic equipment on
a 10-acre site at 620-640 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto, Santa Clara County, California, until 1986. In July
1981, at least 300 gallons of waste solvents, including 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, toluene,
xylene, and alcohols, leaked from a buried storage tank for a period of at least 3 weeks. The company
excavated the tank and approximately 100 cubic yards of contaminated soil and transported the materials
to a hazardous waste facility regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
Since 1982, the company has been pumping and treating contaminated ground water.
 
Tests conducted in 1986 by a consultant to Hewlett-Packard detected trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, 1,1-
dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and xylene, several in high concentrations
(290,000 parts per billion) in ground water under the tank area. An estimated 57,000 people obtain drinking
water from municipal wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
In 1987, Hewlett-Packard excavated an additional 810 cubic yards of soil around the former tank area.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : Hewlett-Packard is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/
FS) to determine the type and extent of off-site contamination and identify alternatives for remedial action.
A report on the RI/FS is due in February 1990.
