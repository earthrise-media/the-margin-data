NPL Site Narrative for Beulah Landfill
 
BEULAH LANDFILL
Pensacola, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Beulah Landfill covers 80 acres in Pensacola, Escambia
County, Florida. Escambia County operated the landfill during 1965-84. The site is divided into two areas
that were operated independently. The north side received primarily municipal trash. The south side,
essentially a sludge disposal pit, first received domestic septic tank wastes in 1968 and continued to
receive municipal trash, industrial waste, demolition debris, and municipal sludges until 1984, when the
State ordered operations at the pit to halt. From February 1980 to June 1986, the landfill operated under a
Consent Order with the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation to accept specified wastes.
 
Tests conducted by EPA indicate that wastes on the site contain chlordane, copper, and zinc. Analyses
of both surface water and ground water show slight increases in concentrations of zinc from upstream to
downstream and from upgradient to downgradient. Eleven Mile Creek at the downstream edge of the site
is used for recreational activities. A number of residences within 3 miles of the landfill draw drinking water
from the upper 150 feet of the local sand and gravel aquifer. The nearest well is 700 feet from the site.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : Escambia County has entered into a Consent Order with the Florida
Department of Environmental Regulation to close the site in accordance with State regulations.
