NPL Site Narrative for Krysowaty Farm
 
KRYSOWATY FARM
Hillsborough, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at proposal (July 23, 1982) : The Krysowaty Farm is located in Hillsborough, Somerset
County, New Jersey. The south branch of the Raritan River is 0.3 mile from the site. Between 1965 and
1970, various chemicals, including paint and dye wastes, were disposed of in 5 acres along a ravine at one
end of the 42-acre farm. In late 1980, a witness to the dumping came forward after the farm owner died.
Eyewitness accounts estimate that 500 drums of waste were dumped in the ravine, along with unknown
volumes of waste solvents and sludge. In July 1981, the township and the State excavated 20 to 30
drums at the site. Studies indicate that both ground water and surface water are contaminated with volatile
organic compounds. The closest residences, about 900 feet from the disposal area, depend on private
wells for drinking water.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : In December 1982, EPA signed a $300,000 Superfund State Contract with
New Jersey for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the fourth
quarter of 1983.
 
Status (February 22, 1989) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with the
State of New Jersey, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA
has been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
