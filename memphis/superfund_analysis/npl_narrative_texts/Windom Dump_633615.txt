Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Windom Dump covers 30 acres in Windom, Cottonwood

and also accepted solvent and heavy metal wastes. Wastes were burned and the residues buried on-site.
Monitoring wells at the site are contaminated with volatile organic chemicals, according to tests conducted
by the State. To date, municipal and residential wells are not contaminated. The monitoring and municipal
wells continue to be sampled by the city and the State.
 
About 5,900 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The State has completed a preliminary investigation and identified several parties
potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
 
The city is monitoring ground water on and off the site under the supervision of the State. Recent samples
from on-site monitoring wells contained high levels of benzene.
