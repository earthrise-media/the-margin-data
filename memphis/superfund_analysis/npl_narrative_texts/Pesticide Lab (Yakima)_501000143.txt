NPL Site Narrative for Pesticide Lab
(Yakima)
 
PESTICIDE LAB (YAKIMA)
Yakima, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Pesticide Lab Site covers about 40 acres in Yakima,
Washington. The site is leased by the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Over the years, wastes from
the pesticide storage/formulation/mixing facility at the Central Washington Experimental Laboratory of
the USDA have been discharged into an on-site septic tank disposal system. As a result of this disposal,
pesticides have permeated the soils and may have contaminated ground water. The site is about 3 miles
from the backup sources for Yakima's drinking water. Irrigation is the primary use of downstream surface
water and ground water. Contaminants in the water could be taken up by crops.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State and USDA are working together to determine what actions are needed
and to prepare a schedule for doing them. USDA has started sampling the soil. Preliminary results are
expected in late summer 1983.
