NPL Site Narrative for Taylor Borough
Dump
 
TAYLOR BOROUGH DUMP
Taylor Borough, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Taylor Borough Dump covers about 60 acres in Taylor
Borough, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania. It is near a residential area and a community park. The
privately owned site served as a municipal dump in the mid-1960s. Over 1,000 drums are piled and
scattered over the surface. Records indicate materials containing hazardous substances were dumped on-
site. Extensive sampling of the drums by EPA has found elevated levels of a range of metals and organic
compounds. EPA has also detected organic compounds such as chloroform and trichloroethylene in the air
around the drums.
 
Status (June 1984) : Late in 1983, EPA removed the surface drums using $375,000 in CERCLA
emergency funds. Approximately 253 tons of hazardous solids and 1,595 gallons of liquids were removed.
In addition, security gates were erected at the access roads to prevent midnight dumping.
 
EPA has also begun a remedial investigation aimed primarily at defining the extent of soil contamination
and determining if buried waste poses a threat to human health and/or the environment. After the remedial
investigation is completed, EPA will conduct a feasibility study to determine the need for additional cleanup
and, if needed, the type of cleanup measures.
