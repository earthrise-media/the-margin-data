NPL Site Narrative for Ott/Story/Cordova
Chemical Co.
 
OTT/STORY/CORDOVA CHEMICAL CO.
Dalton Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Ott/Story/Cordova Chemical Co. Site is in Dalton Township,
Muskegon County, Michigan. Various companies, including Ott Chemical and Story Chemical, occupied
the site between 1957 and 1977, when it was abandoned by Story Chemical. In that period, waste water
was placed in seepage lagoons, resulting in extensive contamination of ground water and soil. Unprotected
tanks of phosgene gas were on-site, as well as 8,700 drums. Before acquiring the facility in late 1977,
Cordova and the State entered a Stipulation and Consent Order whereby Cordova agreed to neutralize
and dispose of the phosgene gas and pay $600,000 to the State to deal with the other problems at the
site. The State agreed to use $500,000 to remove the drums and 8,000 cubic yards of sludges and
contaminated soil, and to use $100,000 to plan an alternative water supply system for affected residents.
 
About 1.2 billion gallons of ground water contaminated with organic chemicals are currently moving into
Little Bear Creek and its tributary, seriously degrading 1 mile of stream.
 
Status (July 1983) : All drums were removed from the site, and a municipal water line was extended to
residents with threatened or contaminated wells.
