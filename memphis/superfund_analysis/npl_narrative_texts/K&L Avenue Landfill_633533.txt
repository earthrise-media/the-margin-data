NPL Site Narrative for K&L Avenue
Landfill
 
K&L AVENUE LANDFILL
Oshtemo Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The K&L Avenue Landfill covers 5 acres in Oshtemo Township,
Kalamazoo, Michigan. It was owned and operated by Kalamazoo County from 1968 to 1975. The landfill
accepted municipal and industrial wastes. Residential wells near the landfill became contaminated with
organic compounds, including chloroform, trichloroethylene, and perchloroethylene. In 1979, homeowners
near the site brought suit against the county. As a result, the county provided an alternative water supply
and capped the landfill. The cap is not adequate, and leachate enters nearby surface waters.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
