NPL Site Narrative for Tomah Municipal
Sanitary Landfill
 
TOMAH MUNICIPAL SANITARY LANDFILL
Tomah, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Tomah Municipal Sanitary Landfill covers 40 acres, of
which 17 acres have been filled, in a rural area in Monroe County outside Tomah, Wisconsin. The City of
Tomah owned and operated the site from 1960 to 1979. It was licensed by the State to accept municipal
refuse. One local facility, Union Camp Corp., notified EPA, as required by Section 103(c) of CERCLA, that
it had sent to the landfill 1,514 drums of wastes containing barium, chromium, lead, spent halogenated and
nonhalogenated solvents, ethyl acetate, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.
 
In June 1984, EPA inspected the site and sampled ground water and sediments in Deer Creek, which
runs through the property 250 feet north of the filled area. On-site ground water was contaminated with
chromium, lead, benzene, 1,1-dichloroethane, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethylene, and
vinyl chloride. The sediments were contaminated with arsenic, chromium, copper, lead, zinc, toluene,
tetrachloroethylene, and 2-butanone.
 
Approximately 9,200 people obtain drinking water from Tomah municipal wells and private wells within 3
miles of the site. Deer Creek, which is nearby, is a trout stream. A fresh water wetland is within 1,000 feet
of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA's preliminary plan for fiscal year 1989 calls for beginning negotiations with
parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site to conduct a remedial investigation/
feasibility study which will determine the type and extent of contamination and identify alternatives for
remedial action.
