NPL Site Narrative for Burrows Sanitation
 
BURROWS SANITATION
Hartford, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Burrows Sanitation Site covers 4 acres in a mostly rural
area about 1 mile from Hartford, Michigan. The privately owned company accepted industrial sludges
from 1970 to 1977. Six lagoons containing metal hydroxide sludge remain on-site. Sampling of the
lagoons by the State indicates high levels of lead, chromium, zinc, and nickel. Monitoring wells on-site
are contaminated with heavy metals, but private wells nearby show no contamination as yet. The berms
around the lagoons have been breached in places, and the lagoons overflow during heavy rains. The State
estimates that 2,000 to 4,000 gallons of sludge have been lost to surrounding areas. Flow from the site is
toward the Paw Paw River.
 
Status (June 1984) : On June 8, 1984, EPA issued an Administrative Order requiring the parties
responsible for wastes associated with the site to start an immediate cleanup of the site.
