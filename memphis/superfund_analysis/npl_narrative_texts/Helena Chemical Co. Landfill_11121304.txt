NPL Site Narrative for Helena Chemical
Co. Landfill
 
HELENA CHEMICAL CO. LANDFILL
Fairfax, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Helena Chemical Co. formulated pesticides in Fairfax, Allendale
County, South Carolina, during 1971-78. The company disposed of pesticides and empty pesticide
containers in an unlined landfill measuring approximately 100 by 150 by 8 feet. In the spring of 1984, the
company removed some of the waste, transported it to a regulated hazardous waste facility, and capped
the site.
 
In March 1985, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) detected
2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-TP (also known as Silvex) in shallow on-site monitoring wells.
The shallow aquifer is hydraulically connected to the lower aquifer, permitting water to move to the lower
aquifer. The lower aquifer provides water to Fairfax municipal wells within 3 miles of the site that serve
approximately 2,200 people. The nearest municipal well is approximately 500 feet from the site.
 
In March 1985, SCDHEC also detected high levels of pesticides in sediment in and around the landfill.
 
In October 1981, SCDHEC and Helena signed a Consent Order requiring the company to study the
contamination and then clean up the site. In December 1981, the two parties agreed to cleanup schedules.
Under a March 1984 agreement with SCDHEC, Helena is to cover the landfill with an impermeable clay
cap and monitor ground water for at least 30 years.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : In March 1989, EPA and Helena Chemical signed an Administrative Order
on Consent under which the company will conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine
the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. Field work is
expected to start in early 1990.
