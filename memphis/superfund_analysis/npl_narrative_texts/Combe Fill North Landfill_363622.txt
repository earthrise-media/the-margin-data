NPL Site Narrative for Combe Fill North
Landfill
 
COMBE FILL NORTH LANDFILL
Mount Olive Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Combe Fill North Landfill (formerly the Morris County
Landfill) occupies about 102 acres in Mount Olive Township, New Jersey. Between 1966 and 1981, the
landfill accepted municipal and industrial (nonchemical) wastes. When the landfill closed, procedures
specified by the State were not followed.
 
Ground water on- and off-site contains numerous organic contaminants, as do residential wells
downgradient of the site. Air monitoring on the landfill has also detected several organic contaminants. An
incident in which an individual contacted sulfuric acid on the site is also recorded. Because the majority of
the population surrounding the landfill relies on private or municipal wells, a potential public health threat
exists. Additionally, the site is not fenced or capped, and gases can migrate off-site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
