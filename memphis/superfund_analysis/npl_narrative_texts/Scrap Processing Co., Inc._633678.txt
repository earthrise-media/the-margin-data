NPL Site Narrative for Scrap Processing
Co., Inc.
 
SCRAP PROCESSING CO., INC.
Medford, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Scrap Processing Co., Inc., operated a salvage yard on a 2-
acre site in Medford, Taylor County, Wisconsin. Between 1955 and 1974, the company cracked lead/acid
batteries on-site to reclaim lead. The equivalent of 399,000 gallons of acid wastes contaminated with lead
were contained in a small unlined pond. The pond has intermittently overflowed into the nearby Black
River, contaminating it with lead, cadmium, copper, and acids, according to analyses conducted by the
State. Acid wastes have seeped into the soil and can potentially contaminate ground water. The area
between the pond and the river is almost devoid of vegetation.
 
Status (June 1984) : As a result of an enforcement action brought by the State, the company has been
ordered to clean up the site.
