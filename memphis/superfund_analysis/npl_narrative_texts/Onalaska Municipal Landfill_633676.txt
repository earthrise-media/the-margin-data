NPL Site Narrative for Onalaska Municipal
Landfill
 
ONALASKA MUNICIPAL LANDFILL
Onalaska, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Town of Onalaska owns and operated a landfill in
Onalaska, about 10 miles north of La Crosse, La Crosse County, Wisconsin, from 1969 to 1980. The
site is within 500 feet of the Black River, near where it meets the Mississippi River. The landfill accepted
residential, commercial, and industrial wastes. The site operators buried various laboratory solvents from
1971 to 1974 and significant quantities of naphtha and PTL-1009, a synthetic lubricant, from 1975 to
1978. The equivalent of 2,500 drums of solvent wastes are estimated to have been disposed on-site. Soils
underneath the unlined disposal site are highly permeable, and ground water is believed to rise into the
waste during part of the year. As a result, although the landfill was covered in 1982, waste products are
leaching through the soil. Sampling by the State established that ground water and a nearby private well
are contaminated with various organic compounds.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
