NPL Site Narrative for Tippecanoe
Sanitary Landfill, Inc
 
TIPPECANOE SANITARY LANDFILL, INC
Lafayette, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Tippecanoe Sanitary Landfill, Inc. (TSL) operates a 51-acre
landfill in Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, Indiana. In 1971, the company received a permit from the State
to accept municipal waste. Open dumping had occurred for an unknown period prior to that date. In 1978,
the State did not renew the site's operating permit because of shallow ground water and highly permeable
subsurface materials at the site. A series of appeals followed, and the facility is currently operating without
a permit.
 
In 1979, ALCOA, Lafayette, Indiana, advised the State that its aluminum-lime sludge, which had been
hauled to the site since 1973, had been found to contain significant levels of PCBs. Disposal of the sludge
ceased, but considerable quantities had already been deposited at the site.
 
In December 1983, the Indiana State Board of Health found that a nearby well contained PCBs and
acetone, as well as lead and cadmium, at levels exceeding Federal primary drinking water standards. An
estimated 81,000 people obtain drinking water from public and private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
In May 1987, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) started litigation to
permanently enjoin TSL from operating.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : A Consent Decree with IDEM dated November 29, 1988, required TSL to stop
accepting solid wastes by October 1, 1989, remove all personnel and equipment by October 31, 1989, and
place a cover of soil on filled areas.
 
TSL filed a bankruptcy petition in February 1989. The landfill closed in September 1989.
 
A TSL contractor started to cap the filled areas, but the capping is not yet complete.
 
EPA issued "special notice letters" to 17 parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site,
offering them the opportunity to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine
the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. Following
negotiation with EPA and IDEM, 10 of the parties signed a CERCLA Administrative Order on Consent,
effective March 8, 1990, to conduct the RI/FS.
