NPL Site Narrative for Flowood Site
 
FLOWOOD SITE
Flowood, Mississippi
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Flowood Site covers about 2 acres approximately 500 feet
behind two large industrial facilities in Flowood, Mississippi. The site consists of a ditch that drains into
Neely Creek. Industrial waste water was discharged without a State permit into the ditch from the 1950s
until 1972. The discharge consisted of ceramic wastes, waste inks, and oil. Samples collected by the State
from the ditch have high levels of lead. The primary threat from the site appears to be to Neely Creek, a
tributary of the Pearl River. There are no surface water intakes downstream within 3 miles. Contamination
of ground water has not been documented to date.
 
This is the top priority site in Mississippi.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
