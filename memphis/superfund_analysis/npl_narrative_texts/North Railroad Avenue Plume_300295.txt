NPL Site Narrative for North Railroad
Avenue Plume
 
NORTH RAILROAD AVENUE PLUME
Espanola, New Mexico
 
 
Conditions at Proposal (July 28, 1998) : A plume of contaminated ground water has been identified in
Espanola, Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. The precise extent of the plume has not yet been identified;
however, based on analyses of ground water from 7 wells, it is approximately 16 acres in area. The
primary contaminants detected in the ground water plume are trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, cis-1,2-
dichloroethene, and trans-1,2-trichloroethene. Adequate information is not currently available to directly
attribute contamination detected at the potential sources to the ground water plume, therefore, the site has
been scored based on a contaminated ground water plume with no source identified.
 
Based on analytical results from various investigations conducted in the town of Espanola, a plume of
contaminated ground water at concentrations ranging up to 525 micrograms per liter (Âµg/L) has been
identified. The ground water pathway contamination is of concern because of the documentation of
observed releases in ground water (2 public supply wells, 2 private drinking water wells, and 3 monitoring
wells) and the fact that the contaminated aquifer is the sole source of drinking water in the area. Two public
supply wells displayed concentrations that exceeded health-based benchmarks (cancer risk and/or MCL).
Use of these public supply wells were discontinued in December 1989 and January 1990, respectively.
 
Status (January 1999) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
