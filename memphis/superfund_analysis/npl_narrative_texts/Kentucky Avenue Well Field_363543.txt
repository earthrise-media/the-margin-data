NPL Site Narrative for Kentucky Avenue
Well Field
 
KENTUCKY AVENUE WELL FIELD
Horseheads, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Kentucky Avenue Well Field in Horseheads, New York, is part of
the Elmira Water Board system, which supplies water to over 60,000 residents in Elmira, Elmira Heights,
and Horseheads, New York. In September 1980, the well field was closed because it was contaminated
with trichloroethylene. Private water wells believed to be in the same aquifer, including an industrial well
serving Facet Enterprises, Inc., were also contaminated. The Elmira Water Board is using temporary
alternative water supplies instead of the Kentucky Avenue Wells.
 
Four known disposal sites operated in the area in the 1940s and 1950s; the source of ground water
contamination, however, is unclear. EPA detected metals, phthalates, and tetrachloroethylene in surface
water upgradient of the well field.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA has conducted an initial evaluation of the need for remedial action at the site.
