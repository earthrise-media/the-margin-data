NPL Site Narrative for Bally Ground Water
Contamination
 
BALLY GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Bally Borough, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The 5,100 people in the Borough of Bally, Berks County,
Pennsylvania, depend on wells for their drinking water. No alternative water supplies are presently
available. Tests conducted by the Borough of Bally and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental
Resources (PA DER) detected up to 3,000 parts per billion of 1,1,1-trichloroethane in Well #3 of the Bally
Municipal Authority. In December 1982, the authority took Well #3 out of service. To remove volatile
organic chemicals, the authority pumps water from the well and sprays it into a pond that discharges into
the West Branch of Perkiomen Creek.
 
The source of the Bally ground water contamination is unknown at this time. According to a study
performed by PA DER, the probable source is Bally Case and Cooler Co., which manufactures urethane-
insulated panels for refrigerating units on a site approximately 1,000 feet to the south of municipal Well #3.
The company used lagoons on its property to dispose of plant wastes from at least 1960 to 1965. Later, a
plant office and parking lot were built on the old lagoon areas.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : In January 1987, EPA entered into a Consent Order with Bally Case and Cooler
Co. to conduct a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site. The
work is now underway.
