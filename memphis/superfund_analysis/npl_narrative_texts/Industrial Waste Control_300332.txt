NPL Site Narrative for Industrial Waste
Control
 
INDUSTRIAL WASTE CONTROL
Ft. Smith, Arkansas
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Industrial Waste Control Site covers 20 acres 12 miles
southeast of Fort Smith, Sebastian County, Arkansas, near Jenny Lind. The site, originally a surface and
underground coal mine, is now an abandoned industrial and solid waste landfill and surface impoundment.
 
From 1970 to 1979, the facility was used to dispose of sludges and liquid wastes primarily from local
industries. Contaminants of concern include heavy metals and organics. A threat exists that pollutants will
migrate via run-off and subsurface mines. Residents obtain their drinking water primarily from private wells.
An overflow in 1977, allegedly killing livestock and fish, ultimately led to the site closing in 1979.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed
to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. The next step would be a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action.
