NORTHERN ENGRAVING CO.
Sparta, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Northern Engraving Co. owned and operated an acid pit and a
lagoon from the early 1960s until 1983. The site is on the southwestern edge of Sparta, Monroe County,
Wisconsin. The company disposed of wastes from its metal-finishing operations on the site. The lagoon
lies in sandy soil, intercepts the water table, and lies less than 500 feet from the La Crosse River, which is
used for recreational activities. About 4,400 cubic yards of sludges containing heavy metals, cyanides, and
arsenic were deposited in the pit and lagoon, which were unlined and allowed wastes to seep into ground
water. The pit and lagoon were abandoned in the late 1970s. Sludge from the lagoon was buried on-site on
at least one occasion.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
