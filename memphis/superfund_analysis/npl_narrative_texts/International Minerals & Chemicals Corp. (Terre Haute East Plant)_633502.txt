INTERNATIONAL MINERALS & CHEMICAL CORP. (TERRE HAUTE
EAST PLANT)
Terre Haute, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The International Minerals & Chemicals Corp. (IMC) Site
covers 20 acres in Terre Haute, Virgo County, Indiana. Commercial Solvents Corp. manufactured the
insecticide BHC (benzene hexachloride) at the site, known as the Terre Haute East Plant, from 1946
to 1954. IMC purchased Commercial Solvents in 1975. In 1980, IMC excavated 14,392 cubic yards of
contaminated soil, piping, vegetation, and debris from the former BHC production area. Soil contaminated
with BHC was also excavated at a former off-site disposal area. The excavated material was combined and
deposited as a mound on 1.2 acres of East Plant property. The mound was capped with clay and fill.
 
Ground water at the site is contaminated with BHC isomers, according to analyses conducted by the State
and EPA. The public water system supplying 63,000 residents of Terre Haute uses wells within 3 miles of
the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
 
Status (February 11, 1991) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Indiana, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
