MONROE AUTO EQUIPMENT CO. (PARAGOULD PIT)
Paragould, Arkansas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : The Monroe Auto Equipment Co. Pit covers 4 acres
including a 1-acre disposal area on Finch Road in Paragould, Greene County, Arkansas. The area around
the site is rural.
 
In 1973, the company received temporary approval from the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control
to dispose of electroplating sludges into a pit that had formerly been mined for sand and gravel. During
1973-78, the company buried approximately 15,400 cubic yards of sludge containing iron, nickel,
chromium, and zinc in the pit. The sludges also contained trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
which were used as degreasers during the electroplating process.
 
On-site monitoring wells and a private drinking water well 300 feet southeast (downgradient) of the pit are
contaminated with 1,1-dichloroethane and 1,2-dichloroethylene, according to tests conducted in 1987-88
by the Arkansas Department of Health and a Monroe consultant. The consultant also found arsenic, nickel,
and lead in the monitoring wells. An estimated 2,100 people obtain drinking water from private wells within
3 miles of the site.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : Monroe continues to monitor ground water at the site.
