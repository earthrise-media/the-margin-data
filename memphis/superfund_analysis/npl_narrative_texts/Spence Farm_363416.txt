NPL Site Narrative for Spence Farm
 
SPENCE FARM
Plumstead Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Spence Farm occupies 5 acres in Plumstead Township, Ocean
County, New Jersey. The site, a working farm, is flat, dropping off into a marshy, wooded floodplain. The
population in the area relies on ground water for drinking water and surface water for irrigation. Between
1963 and 1970, drums and free-flowing liquid were dumped off the edge of the field into the floodplain,
then covered over. A limited investigation by the State found a number of organic and inorganic pollutants
in ground water and surface water, and organic pollutants in air.
 
The Spence Farm, Friedman Property, Goose Farm, and Pijak Farm (the so-called "Plumstead Sites") are
within a 2-mile radius.
 
Status (July 1983) : In September 1982, EPA awarded a $2,538,000 Cooperative Agreement to New
Jersey. Under the agreement, $288,000 is being used on a feasibility study to evaluate various alternative
methods for excavating the waste and disposing of it. The study is scheduled to be completed in the
second quarter of 1984. The remaining $2,250,000 is to design and implement the alternative selected.
