NPL Site Narrative for Colbert Landfill
 
COLBERT LANDFILL
Spokane, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Colbert Landfill, owned and operated by Spokane County, is
located in Colbert, 10 miles north of Spokane, Washington. For 5 years, the 40-acre landfill accepted liquid
solvent wastes and buried them in unlined pits in permeable soil. The surrounding rural area depends on
nearby ground water for drinking water and irrigation. No alternative supply is readily available. Some wells
are contaminated by the same organic solvents that were dumped at the landfill, which continues to accept
municipal wastes.
 
In September 1981, EPA awarded an $80,000 Cooperative Agreement to Washington, using funds
available under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, for a remedial investigation to determine the
source of ground water contamination. The work was completed in July 1982.
 
Status (July 1983) : Among options being considered for the future are: capping the landfill, conducting
long-term monitoring studies of ground water, and providing alternate water supplies to those families
using contaminated wells.
