NPL Site Narrative for New Castle Steel
 
NEW CASTLE STEEL
New Castle County, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at proposal (December 30, 1982) : The New Castle Steel Site covers 3 acres in New Castle,
Delaware. It produces iron castings for commercial use. Since 1973, a by-product of the process, electric
furnace dust (classified as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), has
been stored in piles on-site. The plant started to recycle the dust in its furnace in December 1980. Run-off
from the site is contaminated. There is also the potential for contamination of ground water.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : EPA is preparing a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site.
 
The State is negotiating with the company for cleanup under the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act.
 
Status (March 17, 1989) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with the
State of Delaware, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
