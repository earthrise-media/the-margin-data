NPL Site Narrative for Scientific Chemical
Processing
 
SCIENTIFIC CHEMICAL PROCESSING
Carlstadt, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Scientific Chemical Processing, Inc., recovered and recycled
various chemical wastes on a 13.5-acre site in Carlstadt, Bergen County, New Jersey. As a result of a
State Order, the company ceased operations in 1980. About 375,000 gallons of hazardous substances
are stored on the site in tanks, drums, and tank trailers. Soils are extensively contaminated, probably from
spillage. Ground water contamination is likely. Run-off from the site is contaminated. The site is located
within a coastal wetlands management area, bordered on the northeast by Peach Island Creek, a tidal
waterway. Local surface water is used for recreation and industrial water supplies.
 
Status (July 1983) : In 1983, three corporate officers of Scientific Chemical Processing were convicted in
Federal District Court of mail fraud charges resulting from the improper disposal of chemical wastes. The
State has filed a Civil Complaint against the owner and operators of the site to require full cleanup of the
site. In addition, EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
