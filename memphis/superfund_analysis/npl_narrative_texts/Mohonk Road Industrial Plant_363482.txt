MOHONK ROAD INDUSTRIAL PLANT
High Falls, New York
 
 
Conditions at Proposal (September 26, 1999) : The Mohonk Road Industrial Plant site in High Falls,
Ulster County, New York is apparently responsible for the contamination of more than 60 private wells.
Industrial activity at the site began when Varifab owned and operated the facility from the early 1960s until
1969. The facility reportedly used TCE in their processes of assembling and finishing metal parts for cash
registers. Consolidated Diesel bought the company and property in 1969 and operated the facility until
1972. Another company, Ballards, performed "wet" spray painting of metal parts at the facility sometime
between 1972 and 1975. Gelles Associates purchased the facility in 1976 and began manufacturing plastic
and metal store display fixtures. Gelles' coating process generated "waste lacquer" until 1991, when the
company began using electrostatic powder coating. According to a May 1991 Notification of Regulated
Waste Activity, the company generated more than 1,000 kilograms per month of hazardous waste listed as
F002 (spent halogenated solvents such as PCE; TCE; and 1,1,1-TCA) and F003 (spent non-halogenated
solvents).
 
Three sources are identified on site. Source 1 was a 1,000-gallon underground tank that was located
approximately 100 feet north of the on-site building. Tank sludge samples collected by New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) contained up to 26% of 1,1,1-TCA, 1.8% of 1,1-
DCA, and 0.51% of chloroform. Several base/neutral/acid extractable (BNA) compounds, the pesticides
endrin and alpha-chlordane, and several heavy metals were also detected in the sludge. The tank, its
contents, and approximately 25 cubic yards of stained soil associated with it were removed from the site
beginning in September 1997. The activity is not an HRS qualifying removal because of the continued
presence of an associated ground water plume. Source 2 is contaminated soil near Source 1. Soil-gas and
soil samples collected near the tank showed concentrations of 1,1,1-TCA ranging up to 4,600 µg/kg. Other
chlorinated VOCs, including 1,1-DCA; 1,1-DCE; and TCE, were also detected. Source 3 is contaminated
soil near the west side of the building. During the site reconnaissance in September 1996, NYSDEC
pointed out the west and northwest sides of the building where drums were formerly stored, the open area
off the northwest end of the building, and the edge of the driveway at the west end of the building as areas
where disposal was suspected to have occurred. NYSDEC investigated the area west of the building as
part of the soil-gas and soil sampling activities conducted in October 1996. Soil-gas samples collected
from the grass- and gravel-covered area showed detectable levels of 1,1,1-TCA and several other VOCs,
including tetrachloroethene (PCE). NYSDEC collected more than 40 soil samples at depths ranging from
1 to 13 feet below grade in the area west of the building. High concentrations of PCE and cis-1,2-DCE
were detected at one boring location. The concentrations of 1,1,1-TCA ranged up to 660 µg/kg. Other
chlorinated VOCs, including 1,1-DCE; 1,1-DCA; TCE; and 1,2-DCA, as well as the BNA compounds 2-
methylnaphthalene and phenanthrene, were detected in this area.
 
Between June 1994 and October 1995, NYSDEC provided granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration
systems to 64 homes and businesses located downgradient of the site where VOC levels exceeded the
New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) drinking water standard. Semi-annual sampling between
November 1994 and November 1997 confirmed the presence of chlorinated VOCs in the private wells,
and showed a maximum 1,1,1-TCA concentration of 1,400 parts per billion (ppb). Samples from on-site
monitoring wells located near the 1,000-gallon underground tank have shown concentrations of 1,1,1-TCA
up to 28,000 µg/L at the till/bedrock interface and up to 3,900 µg/L in the bedrock.
 
Almost all domestic wells in the site vicinity withdraw water from the Shawangunk Formation. The
estimated total population served by ground water wells within 4 miles of the site is 6,234. An observed
release to ground water is documented by validated data for samples collected from private wells in May
1997. Contamination is documented for 57 downgradient wells serving a total of 208 people.
 
Status (January 1999) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
