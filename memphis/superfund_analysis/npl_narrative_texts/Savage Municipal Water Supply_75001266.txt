NPL Site Narrative for Savage Municipal
Water Supply
 
SAVAGE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY
Milford, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Savage Municipal Wells in Milford, New Hampshire,
encompass an area of about 30 acres. Routine sampling of the well field by the State detected volatile
organic chemicals, including tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1-dichloroethane, and 1,1,1-
trichloroethane. Similar compounds were detected in adjacent surface waters. Alternative water supplies
had to be installed to maintain service to existing residential and commercial units. Further investigation is
needed to determine the source and extent of contamination in and adjacent to the well field.
 
The State has previously issued cleanup orders to parties alleged to be responsible for the discharge
of volatile organic chemicals in the general area of the well field. In response, some of the parties have
started hydrogeologic studies to determine the extent of contamination possibly caused by earlier industrial
activities at their respective facilities.
 
Status (June 1984) : The parties are scheduled to submit their reports to the State by the fall of 1984. The
State is planning to conduct a limited hydrogeologic investigation during the summer of 1984.
