NPL Site Narrative for General Mills/
Henkel Corp.
 
GENERAL MILLS/HENKEL CORP.
Minneapolis, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Henkel Corp. operates in an industrial and residential area
of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Before selling the site to Henkel, General Mills Corp. operated a research
laboratory there from about 1947 to 1962. During that time, General Mills disposed of about 1,000
gallons per year of laboratory solvents in a dry well to a depth of 10 feet. The State's analyses of soil,
shallow ground water, and the deeper bedrock Prairie du Chien-Jordan aquifer detected volatile organic
compounds. Both aquifers recharge the Mississippi River, from which Minneapolis obtains its drinking
water. The Town of St. Anthony (population 8,000) obtains its drinking water from the Prairie du Chien-
Jordan aquifer, but its wells are about 2.5 miles upgradient from the site.
 
The State has been working with General Mills to complete the investigation and cleanup of the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State is developing a Consent Order for General Mills to complete the
investigation and cleanup of the site.
