NPL Site Narrative for Pine Bend Sanitary
Landfill
 
PINE BEND SANITARY LANDFILL
Dakota County, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Pine Bend Sanitary Landfill covers about 232 acres
west of the Mississippi River in Dakota County, Minnesota. It is owned by Browning Ferris Industries and
operated by its Phoenix, Inc., subsidiary. Operation of the landfill has produced a leachate containing
arsenic, halogenated and nonhalogenated organic compounds, and various chlorides. The leachate has
severely contaminated on-site surface water and ground water with these materials, according to analyses
conducted by the State and EPA.
 
This site was first proposed for listing under the name "Pine Bend Sanitary Landfill/Crosby American
Demolition Landfill."
 
Various nearby residential wells are contaminated with heavy metals and volatile chlorinated and
nonchlorinated organic compounds, according to analyses conducted by the State and EPA. The
residences, farms, and industry of the area depend on wells for drinking water. About 3,500 people are
affected.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : On April 23, 1985, the State entered into an agreement with Pine Bend Sanitary
Landfill and the adjacent Crosby American Demolition Landfill to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action. A report on the remedial investigation is expected shortly.
