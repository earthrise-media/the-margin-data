NPL Site Narrative for Koppers Co., Inc.
(Florence Plant)
 
KOPPERS CO., INC. (FLORENCE PLANT)
Florence, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Koppers Co., Inc., treats and preserves wood with creosote and
pentachlorophenol on a 20-acre site in Florence, Florence County, South Carolina. The company has had
numerous difficulties in the past with contaminated run-off. The primary problem at this site, however, is
an old evaporation lagoon closed since 1979. It has led to contamination of six of nine monitoring wells
on-site, according to company data. The State has detected contamination in private wells off-site. At
least 1,200 people use the shallow aquifer for drinking water. Surface water contamination has not been
documented to date. In October 1981, the State issued a Consent Order requiring the company to conduct
a ground water study.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State is reviewing the company's response to an amended Consent Order which
calls for the company to (1) complete installation of a monitoring well, (2) report on the progress of a
sampling program, (3) submit a hydrological report, and (4) submit a plan for remedial action.
