NPL Site Narrative for Northside Sanitary
Landfill, Inc.
 
NORTHSIDE SANITARY LANDFILL, INC.
Zionsville, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Northside Sanitary Landfill, Inc., Site covers 131 acres
in Zionsville, Indiana. Over 16 million gallons of hazardous wastes have been deposited in the landfill.
It opened in the 1950s as an open dump, and was permitted by the State in 1971 to accept hazardous
wastes.
 
EPA (under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act) and the State have responded to complaints about
the site. In response, the owner installed a leachate collection system, but leachate is still not totally
contained. Analyses of surface water and soil by the State detected organic chemicals, including benzene,
acetone, xylene, phenol, and chloroform, as well as lead. If the leachate collection system is not pumped
out properly, it can overflow into ground water. The clay liner of the landfill may not be continuous, thus
threatening ground water. About 1,750 residents within 3 miles of the site use wells for drinking water.
 
In June 1983, the State ordered the site to close. The corporation has appealed the action.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA has started a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and to identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
Administrative hearings are underway regarding the State's closure order.
