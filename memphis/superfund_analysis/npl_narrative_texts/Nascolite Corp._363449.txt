NPL Site Narrative for Nascolite Corp.
 
NASCOLITE CORP.
Millville, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Nascolite Corp. operated an acrylic sheet manufacturing plant
on 15.5 acres in Millville, Cumberland County, New Jersey, from 1953 to 1980, when it closed in response
to an Administrative Order issued by the State. The order required Nascolite to stop discharging waste
water into a nearby ditch, install monitoring wells, and draw up a plan for disposal of waste water in the
future and removal of all waste water and sludges on the site. In September 1981, Nascolite entered into
an Administrative Consent Order with the State. The order repeated the requirements of the previous
Administrative Order and added a provision for removal of contaminated soil. The company, which still
owns the site, has not complied fully with the two orders.
 
Solvents stored in drums and both above- and below-ground tanks have caused extensive contamination
of ground water, according to analyses done by the State. The area is highly dependent on ground water
for drinking supplies.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
