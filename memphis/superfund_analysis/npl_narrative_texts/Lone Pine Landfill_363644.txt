NPL Site Narrative for Lone Pine Landfill
 
LONE PINE LANDFILL
Freehold Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Lone Pine Landfill in Freehold Township, Monmouth county, New
Jersey, operated from 1959 to 1979, when it was closed by the State. Leachate from the 80-acre site
flows into the Manasquan River. Allegedly, 50,000 drums of chemical wastes, as well as free-flowing liquid
wastes, were dumped at the site. Excavation of limited areas of the landfill in September 1981 confirmed
the presence of drums. A number contain organic chemicals. Benzene, toluene, vinyl chloride, lead, and
zinc have been detected in leachate on the site. Downstream, the river has lower levels of the same
chemicals. Monitoring wells have found a variety of organic compounds in both the Vincentown Aquifer and
the deeper Red Bank Aquifer.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1982, EPA signed a $330,000 Superfund State Contract with New Jersey for a
feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action at the site. A draft was released in June 1983.
 
The former general manager of the landfill and a transporter pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the
illegal disposal of drummed waste in the landfill. In addition, three corporate officers of Scientific Chemical
Processing were convicted in Federal District Court of mail fraud charges also related to the illegal disposal
activity.
