NPL Site Narrative for Metamora Landfill
 
METAMORA LANDFILL
Metamora, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Metamora Landfill occupies about 80 acres (about 50
actually landfilled) in a mostly rural area in Metamora, Lapeer County, Michigan. The privately owned
site operated from 1966 to 1980. The generators, amounts, and types of wastes buried at the site are
unknown. A magnetometer survey conducted by the State indicated as many as 35,800 drums could
be buried. The 100 exposed drums contain ethyl benzene, chloroform, toluene, xylene, and other
organic chemicals. Ground water is contaminated with heavy metals, according to the State, although no
residential wells have been contaminated to date. Several fires occurred at the site in 1972 and 1979.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
