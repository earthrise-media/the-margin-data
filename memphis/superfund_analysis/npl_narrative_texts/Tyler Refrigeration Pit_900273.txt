NPL Site Narrative for Tyler Refrigeration
Pit
 
TYLER REFRIGERATION PIT
Smyrna, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Tyler Refrigeration Pit Site involves a 500-cubic-
yard unlined pit in Smyrna, Kent County, Delaware. From at least 1952 to at least 1973, Tyler, which
used solvents to degrease and clean refrigeration equipment, disposed of spent solvents, mostly
trichloroethylene (TCE), and sludge in the pit. Later, Tyler excavated the pit to about 20 feet, filled it in,
capped it with 6 inches of top soil and clay, and planted vegetation. The site is now occupied by Metal
Masters, which manufactures commercial kitchen equipment.
 
In 1982, EPA detected elevated levels of toluene, 1,1-dichloroethane, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) in
on-site soils.
 
TCE has been detected in Smyrna municipal wells since 1977 and 1,1,1-TCA since at least 1982. To
remove contamination from the wells, the town improved the efficiency of its air stripping process and
added an activated carbon filtration unit to its water treatment system. The concentration of TCE in
Smyrna's wells has significantly declined, but the concentration of TCA continues to increase. The
treatment system continues in operation.
 
According to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DDNREC), the
Tyler pit is a likely contributor to the contamination of Smyrna's wells, although there may be other sources.
About 6,700 people depend on wells, both municipal and private, within 3 miles of the site for their drinking
water.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : In January 1988, DDNREC installed monitoring wells at the site. DDNREC
sampling in May 1988 found 1,1,1-TCA, 1,1-dichloroethane, and chromium in a downgradient monitoring
well.
