Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Purity Oil Sales, Inc., Site covers 6 acres in an industrial-
residential area 2 miles south of Fresno in Malaga, Fresno County, California. To the north is a mobile
home park, scrap metal recycling/reclaiming facility, and a combination service station, market, and coffee
shop. An irrigation canal is to the south, Santa Fe Railroad to the west, and South Maple Avenue to the
east. The Fresno Aquifer, about 30 feet below the surface, provides water for municipal, industrial, and
agricultural purposes, as well as for a number of private wells. The area is also a ground water recharge
zone.
 
Oily liquids and sludges have been disposed of on-site for many years. Some liquid wastes remain in
a concrete pond. Former sludge disposal ponds have been filled with construction debris. Soil samples
contain significant concentrations of PCBs, lead, copper, zinc, and various volatile organics. An unknown
sludge-like substance is oozing from the filled areas and has, in places, entered adjacent properties. The
site was closed in 1974. All buildings were removed, and the site was fenced.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has requested CERCLA funding for a remedial investigation/feasibility study
to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
