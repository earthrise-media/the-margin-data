NPL Site Narrative for Walsh Landfill
 
WALSH LANDFILL
Honeybrook Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Walsh Landfill operated on an 8-acre site in Honeybrook
Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. Operations at the unpermitted site reportedly began prior to
1971 and continued until the State forced the landfill to close in 1976. The owner accepted both municipal
and industrial wastes. Samples obtained by the State from on-site monitoring wells (installed by the State
as part of the closure plan) contain organic compounds. Nearby residential wells sampled by the State and
county are also contaminated with organic compounds.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State and EPA have signed a Cooperative Agreement for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. Also, EPA plans to inspect the site in mid-June 1984 to determine if any
immediate response is necessary.
