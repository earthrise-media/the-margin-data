well as industrial wastes containing cyanides, acids, plating and paint sludges, solvents, and pesticides. In
1967, a hauler died when he inadvertently dumped a drum containing acid into a pit containing cyanide.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA worked with the State and the City of Springfield to develop a program to monitor
