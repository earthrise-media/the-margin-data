NPL Site Narrative for Queen City Farms
 
QUEEN CITY FARMS
Maple Valley, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Queen City Farms, Inc., owns a site by the same name which
covers 320 acres about 2.5 miles north of Maple Valley, Washington, and south of King County's Cedar Hill
Landfill. The site includes a wooded area, Queen City Lake, six ponds, a gravel pit, an airstrip, and several
residences. From about 1955 to the late 1960s, at least three of the six ponds were used for disposal of
industrial wastes.
 
In November 1980, EPA detected significant concentrations of a number of heavy metals and organic
chemicals in water and soil from the six ponds. In March 1981, EPA found very low concentrations of PCBs
in five drinking wells in the vicinity of the ponds, but not the same type of PCBs found in the ponds. In June
1983, EPA was granted access to the site to drill test wells. Also in June, the company submitted to EPA a
plan to investigate shallow ground water and take over the investigation EPA had started.
 
Status (June 1984) : The company is beginning development of a second phase of the investigation at the
site. This phase will include construction of several more deep wells to establish the gradient of the lower
regional aquifer and determine if any contaminants are present in this aquifer. Work is also underway to
develop a remedial investigation and focused feasibility study to determine the appropriate interim remedial
measures to remove and/or contain the wastes in the three main ponds.
