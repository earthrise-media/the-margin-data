MODERN SANITATION LANDFILL
Lower Windsor Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Modern Sanitation Landfill covers 72 acres in Lower Windsor
Township, York County, Pennsylvania. The landfill operation is leased from a local farmer. In September
1984, Waste Management Inc. (WMI) purchased the landfill operation from SCA Services, which had
purchased the operation in September 1980 from Modern Trash of York. The landfill reportedly received
hazardous wastes between 1976 and 1979.
 
Toxic organic and inorganic chemicals contaminate ground water underlying the landfill, according to
analyses conducted by the State and EPA. Similar contaminants have been detected in springs adjacent to
the landfill.
 
The State and WMI are working on remedial measures to collect and treat the contaminated ground water
on the western perimeter of the landfill.
 
Between 1,000 and 3,000 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as their source of drinking water.
 
In September 1984, the State and WMI signed a Consent Order and Agreement requiring WMI to operate
and upgrade a leachate collection system on the western perimeter of the landfill, investigate ground water
contamination on the northern and eastern perimeters, and develop a treatment for this contamination.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : WMI is conducting the activities required by its agreement with the State.
