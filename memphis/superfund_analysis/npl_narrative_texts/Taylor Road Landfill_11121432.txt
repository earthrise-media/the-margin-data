NPL Site Narrative for Taylor Road Landfill
 
TAYLOR ROAD LANDFILL
Seffner, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Taylor Road Landfill is owned and was operated by
Hillsborough County in Seffner, Florida, from 1975 until February 1980. This 40-acre landfill was intended
for the disposal of municipal refuse, but unknown quantities of industrial waste may have been deposited.
Private wells in the area are contaminated with volatile organic compounds. At one time, methane gas
for the landfill was detected at concentrations above the lower explosive limit near residences adjacent to
the site. The county installed a gas collection system in an attempt to correct this problem. An inventory
identified 580 wells within 1 mile of this facility. EPA has investigated and sampled the site on several
occasions.
 
In October 1980, the Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, brought a Federal civil suit against the
county seeking injunctive relief.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA and the county have signed a Consent Decree with Hillsborough County Utilities
Department. The decree provides for installation of public water supply to affected residential wells and a
30-year ground water monitoring program for the entire landfill.
