NPL Site Narrative for Independent Nail
Co.
 
INDEPENDENT NAIL CO.
Beaufort, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Independent Nail Co. manufactures metallic screws on a
site 3 miles north of Beaufort, Beaufort County, South Carolina. The company bought the site from Blake
and Johnson in 1980. There is a 1-acre lagoon on the site into which Blake and Johnson placed waste
water containing cyanide, chromium, cadmium, lead, nickel, zinc, copper, and iron. When Independent Nail
bought the site, it asked Blake and Johnson to investigate the quality of ground water. In response, Blake
and Johnson installed three monitoring wells of intermediate depth. Analyses revealed that ground water
has been impacted by the lagoon. Further tests conducted by the State showed that the contaminated
ground water has moved outside of the area covered by the monitoring wells. Surface water has been
locally contaminated by the lagoon, but it is not used as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
