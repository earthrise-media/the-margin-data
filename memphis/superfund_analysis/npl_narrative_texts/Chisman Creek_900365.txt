NPL Site Narrative for Chisman Creek
 
CHISMAN CREEK
York County, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Chisman Creek Site covers 27 acres in a suburban area of
York County, Virginia. From about 1957 to 1980, fly ash from a nearby power station was dumped on
the site in a series of pits adjacent to Chisman Creek. In 1980, nearby shallow residential wells became
contaminated with vanadium and could no longer be used. The homes now must use public water.
 
Status (July 1983) : The Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences has studied contamination at the site and is
expected to release its draft report shortly.
