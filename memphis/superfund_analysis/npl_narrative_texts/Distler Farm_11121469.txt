NPL Site Narrative for Distler Farm
 
DISTLER FARM
Jefferson County, Kentucky
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Distler Farm Site covers 8.7 acres in southwest Jefferson County,
17 miles from Louisville, Kentucky. In January 1979, EPA, using $300,000 made available under Section
311 of the Clean Water Act, responded to the emergency created when flood waters scattered drums
of industrial waste stored at the site along the floodplain of Stump Gap Creek. EPA recovered and
recontainerized 832 drums containing chemicals characteristic of the paint and coatings industry, then
moved them to higher ground. Later, the State sent the drums to an approved disposal facility.
 
During the cleanup, EPA discovered trenches holding buried drums. A limited ground water study,
conducted in October 1981, identified compounds similar to those found in the 1979 emergency. Sampling
of nearby residential wells in 1979 and 1981 showed no contamination associated with waste disposal at
the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA has conducted geophysical surveys and installed monitoring wells to better
define the extent of subsurface contamination. Also, EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master
Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. EPA is
planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the
site and to identify alternatives for remedial action.
