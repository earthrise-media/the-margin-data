LANG PROPERTY
Pemberton Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Lang Property is a 10-acre dump site in Pemberton
Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, just north of Lebanon State Forest. The site is within the Pine
Barrens in an area of blueberry and cranberry farms. About 1,500 drums of wastes were emptied onto
the ground at this site. Localized contamination of ground water and surface water by various chemicals,
including phenols, heavy metals, and trichloroethylene, has been documented. The primary concern is
contamination of the Cohansey Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to Pemberton Township's 13,000
residents. As many as 20 private wells are within 1 mile of this site. In addition, a back-up well for the
Pemberton system is within 3 miles.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
 
In June 1983, the State collected additional ground water samples.
