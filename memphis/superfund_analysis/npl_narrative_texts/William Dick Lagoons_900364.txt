NPL Site Narrative for William Dick
Lagoons
 
WILLIAM DICK LAGOONS
West Caln Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : The William Dick Lagoons cover 10 acres in West Caln
Township in the western part of Chester County, Pennsylvania. From the late 1950s to 1970, the three
unlined lagoons were used by the Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., for disposal of final rinsewater from
the interior cleaning of tank trailers. These trailers reportedly transported petroleum products, latexes, and
resins.
 
According to tests conducted by EPA in April 1985, soils on the site contain 4,4-DDE, benzo(a)pyrene,
trichloroethylene, and 2,4-dichlorophenol.
 
Soils on the site are moderately permeable, thus potentially threatening ground water. The Chickies
Formation within 3 miles of the site is the sole source of water for private wells serving an estimated 1,400
people. The nearest well is 400 feet north of the site.
 
The lagoons were not adequately diked, permitting the contents to reach nearby surface waters. The
13,600 residents of Coatesville draw drinking water from an intake into Birch Run 2.8 miles downstream of
the site.
 
The site is not completely fenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact
with hazardous substances.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA is conducting a search for individuals or companies potentially responsible for
wastes associated with the site and will send them general notice letters informing them of their potential
liability.
