NPL Site Narrative for Resin Disposal
 
RESIN DISPOSAL
Jefferson Borough, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Resin Disposal Site covers 40 acres near the Monongahela
River in Jefferson Borough, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The privately owned site consists of two
unlined, diked ponds situated in a gully between two residential areas. Between 1949 and 1964, these
ponds received about 77,000 tons of industrial waste containing organic solvents, resins, and oils. Once
filled, the ponds were covered with local soil. Leachate is seeping along the base of the second dike.
Monitoring wells on-site and at the edge of the disposal area are contaminated by naphthalene, benzene,
toluene, phenol, lead, and nickel. Leachate leaving the site is similarly contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is negotiating with a party potentially responsible for wastes at the site
regarding collection and treatment of the leachate, a program to recover resins and solvents from the
ground, and sampling of ground water.
