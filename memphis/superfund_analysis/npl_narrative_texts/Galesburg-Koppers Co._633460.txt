NPL Site Narrative for Galesburg/Koppers
Co.
 
GALESBURG/KOPPERS CO.
Galesburg, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Galesburg/Koppers Site covers 400 acres outside
Galesburg, Knox County, Illinois. Koppers Co. treats railroad ties on the site, which is owned by Burlington
Northern Railroad. The plant has been in operation since 1907. In the past, waste water containing
creosote and pentachlorophenol was discharged to four unlined ponds on-site, resulting in contamination
of the shallow aquifer. Contamination has not been detected so far in the deeper aquifer or in the many
private drinking water wells in the area. In 1977, the State required the company to prevent leaching oily
materials from entering a nearby ditch. In response, the company dug an intercepting ditch and dammed
off the existing ditch. Thousands of gallons per year of oily waste are recovered from the intercepting ditch.
In about 1979, two of the three creosote ponds were filled in.
 
Status (July 1983) : The company is negotiating with the State for cleanup of former disposal areas as well
as treatment of current waste water. The company, after completing a hydrogeological study and preparing
a ground water monitoring report, is taking additional ground water samples.
 
In June 1983, EPA completed a draft Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
