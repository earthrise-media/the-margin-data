AMNICOLA DUMP
Chattanooga, Tennessee
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Amnicola Dump covers 18 acres, with 12 acres filled, near the
Tennessee River in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was operated by the city as a municipal dump (on private
property) from 1970 to 1973. Primarily brush and demolition wastes were disposed of, but some industrial
wastes were disposed of as well. When the site closed, it was covered, graded, and revegetated.
 
Seasonal leachate streams containing low concentrations of trichloroethylene leave the site and enter the
adjacent Tennessee River. Water quality downstream has not been affected but will need to be carefully
monitored.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is monitoring water quality near the site.
