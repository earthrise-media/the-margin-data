NPL Site Narrative for Westinghouse
Elevator Co. Plant
 
WESTINGHOUSE ELEVATOR CO. PLANT
Cumberland Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Westinghouse Elevator Co. manufactures elevators on
an 85-acre site in Cumberland Township, Adams County, Pennsylvania. The manufacturing procedure
involves paint and degreasing using chlorinated solvents. In August 1983, the Pennsylvania Department
of Environmental Resources (PA DER) detected trichloroethylene (TCE) in nearby surface water. Further
investigation by the State and EPA found that private wells were also contaminated.
 
Under a CERCLA Section 106 order issued by EPA, Westinghouse supplied 15 homes along Route 34
with an alternate water supply and initiated a hydrogeological study of the site to determine the extent of
the contamination and cleanup alternatives.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In January 1985, EPA and PA DER signed a multisite cooperative agreement
which provides CERCLA funds to the State for various sites, including Westinghouse Elevator Co. Plant.
The funds are to start work on a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
