NPL Site Narrative for Rose Disposal Pit
 
ROSE DISPOSAL PIT
Lanesboro, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Rose Disposal Pit covers 1.5 acres in Lanesboro in
Berkshire County, Massachusetts. From 1951 to 1959, a previous owner used the site to dispose of waste
oils and solvents from the General Electric (GE) Co. plant in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. GE conducted
a field investigation and concluded that 60,000 cubic yards of soil are contaminated with greater than
50 parts per million of PCBs and also that contaminated ground water is leaving the site in two plumes,
traveling in easterly and southerly directions. Ground water is contaminated with 11 volatile organic
compounds, including trichloroethylene, benzene, and vinyl chloride, according to analyses conducted by
EPA.
 
In May 1984, EPA and the State issued a joint enforcement order under CERCLA. It requires GE to secure
and fence the site; plan and schedule a temporary cover for the site; plan and schedule a way to pump
out a free oil layer; and provide a permanent water supply to a restaurant and residence affected by the
plumes.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In November 1984, EPA issued an Administrative Order under CERCLA which
will require GE to conduct a feasibility study of remedial alternatives relevant to soil contamination and
restoration of ground water at the site. GE is in compliance with the joint enforcement order and is
presently conducting the feasibility study.
