NPL Site Narrative for Valley Wood
Preserving, Inc.
 
VALLEY WOOD PRESERVING, INC.
Turlock, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Valley Wood Preserving, Inc., Site covers 9 acres 1 mile
southeast of Turlock, Stanislaus County, California. During 1973-79, the company pressure-treated wood
with a water-based copper-chromate-arsenic solution. In 1979, the county revoked the facility's use permit
in response to neighbors' complaints. A 1979 inspection by the California Regional Water Quality Control
Board (CRWQCB) identified toxic wood-treating chemicals in an on-site storage pond, as well as chromium
in concentrations as high as 3,100 milligrams per kilogram in on- and off-site soils and 178 milligrams per
liter in shallow on-site monitoring wells. Arsenic and copper were also found in the wells.
 
After closing, the company excavated and disposed of approximately 1,500 cubic yards of contaminated
soil from both on- and off-site. Then, in the summer of 1980, Valley Wood began to pump ground water
to the surface, treat it to remove chromium, and discharge it to the ground. The operation continued
intermittently, ceasing entirely in June 1983. Contaminated soil remains on-site under asphalt paving
and may continue to leach chromium into ground water, according to a 1985 report by a consultant to
CRWQCB.
 
The site is underlain by a shallow, unconfined aquifer extending down to 60 feet; a deeper, confined
aquifer, beginning at 80 to 140 feet; and between them, a continuous 20- to 80-foot-thick clay bed known
as the E-clay aquitard. As currently defined, the contaminant plume extends approximately 1,000 feet from
the site toward the southwest, is about 700 feet wide, and reaches the bottom of the shallow aquifer.
 
Private wells near Valley Wood Preserving draw from both the upper and lower aquifers; the municipal
wells for Turlock (population nearly 30,000) draw only from the lower aquifer. An estimated 34,000 people
obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site. Turlock Irrigation District operates over 150 wells
that draw from both aquifers and discharge to ditches used to irrigate walnut orchards and agricultural
crops.
 
On March 18, 1987, the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) issued a Remedial Action Order
calling initially for a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : CDHS plans to complete the RI/FS and select a remedy for the site in the fall of
1989. The State will document its decision in a Remedial Action Plan. EPA will review the final decision to
ensure that the cleanup is consistent with the National Contingency Plan.
