NPL Site Narrative for Haverhill Municipal
Landfill
 
HAVERHILL MUNICIPAL LANDFILL
Haverhill, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Haverhill Municipal Landfill is located adjacent to the
Merrimack River in the City of Haverhill, Essex County, Massachusetts. The landfill consists of three tracts
of land covering a total of about 73 acres. Prior to June 1981, two of the three tracts were reportedly used
for disposal of municipal and commercial refuse, while the other reportedly received liquid wastes and
sludges. In August 1981, the city contracted for a ground water study, and evaluation of the landfill's impact
on the local environment, and development of closure and monitoring plans. The results of that study
indicate that ground water in the vicinity of the landfill is contaminated with volatile organic chemicals such
as benzene, toluene, and xylenes.
 
Two municipal wells, which had supplied drinking water to approximately 6,000 people until they were
closed in 1979 due to volatile organic contamination, lie within 1 mile of the site. These wells are being
investigated as part of work at the Groveland Wells Site, which was placed on the NPL in September 1983.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is reviewing existing analytical and hydrogeologic information. The next step
is a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action.
