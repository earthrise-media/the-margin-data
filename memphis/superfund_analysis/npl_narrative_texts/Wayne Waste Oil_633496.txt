NPL Site Narrative for Wayne Waste Oil
 
WAYNE WASTE OIL
Columbia City, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Wayne Waste Oil, a division of Wayne Reclamation and
Recycling, Inc., owns a 27-acre site in Columbia City, Whitley County, Indiana. From 370,000 to 1.4 million
gallons of wastes were dumped on the surface, into unlined pits, and into a trench. Analyses indicate high
levels of cyanides, lead, chromium, and zinc.
 
The site is bordered by residences and a lumber yard on two sides, and a bend of the Blue River on the
other two sides. Three public wells are located within 220 yards of the site. The primary concern is the
threat to ground water. There are open, leaking drums on-site and waste areas that have been covered
with sands, as evidenced by disturbed surface soils.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is performing a health risk assessment on the site. The final report is due in
late 1983.
