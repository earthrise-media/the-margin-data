NPL Site Narrative for Muskego Sanitary
Landfill
 
MUSKEGO SANITARY LANDFILL
Muskego, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The privately owned Muskego Sanitary Landfill covers 56
acres in Muskego in southeastern Waukesha County, Wisconsin. An active landfill operated by Waste
Management of Wisconsin, Inc., and a rendering plant are to the north of the property. The site was closed
and covered in 1977. Files indicate that prior to the early 1970s, the landfill accepted some hazardous
wastes, including paints and oils. After 1973, so far as is presently known, the landfill accepted only
municipal refuse. The present operator has detected lead and zinc in on-site monitoring wells and nearby
private wells. The State verified the presence of only the zinc in private wells.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
