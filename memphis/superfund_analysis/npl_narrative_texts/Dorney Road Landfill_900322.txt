NPL Site Narrative for Dorney Road
Landfill
 
DORNEY ROAD LANDFILL
Upper Macungie Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Dorney Road Landfill covers 37.5 acres in Upper Macungie
Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, near the Lehigh County-Berks County border. The privately-
owned site operated as an open dump from 1952 to 1966. From 1966 to 1978, it was leased and operated
as a sanitary landfill. However, a variety of municipal and industrial waste is believed to have been buried
at the site over the years. In 1980 and 1983, the State detected benzene, phenol, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
and lead in on-site monitoring wells. Pools of surface water are similarly contaminated.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State and EPA have signed a Cooperative Agreement for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. Also, EPA will assess the site to determine if any immediate response is
necessary.
