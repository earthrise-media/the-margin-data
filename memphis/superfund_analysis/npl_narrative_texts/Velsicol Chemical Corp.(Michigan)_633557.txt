NPL Site Narrative for Velsicol Chemical
Corp.(Michigan)
 
VELSICOL CHEMICAL CORP.(MICHIGAN)
St. Louis, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Velsicol Chemical Corp. Site occupies 50 acres in St.
Louis, Michigan. The plant, once owned by Michigan Chemical Co., manufactured a variety of chemicals,
including polybrominated biphenyls and TRIS. Discharges from the plant and poor housekeeping practices
have contaminated the Pine River and soils and ground water at the site with these compounds. The plant
closed in 1978, and all buildings have been removed. In November 1982, Velsicol agreed to a $38.5 million
combined settlement for cleanup of this site and two others in Michigan--the Gratiot County Landfill and the
Gratiot County Golf Course.
 
Status (July 1983) : Containment activities, including capping and placement of underground slurry walls
around the site, started May 12, 1983. The State and EPA are monitoring these activities. All construction-
related activities for containment are scheduled to be completed in November 1984.
