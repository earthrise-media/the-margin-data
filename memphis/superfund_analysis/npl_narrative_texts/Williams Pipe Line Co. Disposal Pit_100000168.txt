NPL Site Narrative for Williams Pipe Line
Co. Disposal Pit
 
WILLIAMS PIPE LINE CO. DISPOSAL PIT
Sioux Falls, South Dakota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : The Williams Pipe Line Co. Disposal Pit is in the northeast
corner of the company's 12th Street terminal in Sioux Falls, Minnehaha County, South Dakota. The
terminal is bordered on the south by 12th Street (State Highway 42), on the west by Valley View Road and
a residential development, on the north by the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad tracks, and on the east by
Marion Road. The site is 2 miles west of the Big Sioux River and Skunk River.
 
The unlined pit measures 9 feet by 9 feet and is about 7 feet deep. For a number of years prior to 1986, a
variety of wastes generated by the terminal were dumped into the pit. Until the 1970s, wastes were burned
periodically. The pit is now dry and covered with a plastic sheet.
 
Tests conducted in 1986-87 by EPA show that sediment in the pit contains barium, beryllium, chromium,
copper, iron, lead, zinc, benzene, toluene, xylene, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and pesticides.
 
Ground water near the pit is contaminated with 4,4'-DDD, 4,4'-DDT, gamma-chlordane, beta-BHC, and
lead, according to EPA tests conducted in 1989. An estimated 100,000 people in the Sioux Falls area
obtain drinking water from two sets of public wells within 3 miles of the site. One well is about 1.25 miles to
the southeast.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : EPA emergency staff has determined that a removal action is not warranted at
this time.
 
EPA is conducting a search to identify parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
