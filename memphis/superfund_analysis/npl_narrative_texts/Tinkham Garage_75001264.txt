NPL Site Narrative for Tinkham Garage
 
TINKHAM GARAGE
Londonderry, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Tinkham Garage Site covers about 25 acres in Londonderry,
New Hampshire. The open and wooded land is bordered by residential and agricultural land. During the
1970s, oil, oily materials, washings from septic tank trucks, and other substances were discharged on the
site. In May 1978, the State ordered the site owner to prevent further degradation of surface water and
ground water. In November 1981, EPA detected chemicals in ground water at the site. In October 1982,
volatile organic chemicals were identified in surface water and ground water in areas adjacent to the site.
The State confirmed these results independently.
 
Status (July 1983) : In early 1983, wells of the Londonderry Green Apartment complex and several
other private wells were closed due to contamination. CERCLA emergency funds ($150,000) were made
available to truck in bottled and bulk water. A line to the Town of Derry's municipal well will be constructed
as a permanent source of uncontaminated water.
 
EPA has completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the
full extent of cleanup required at the site. Now EPA and the State are negotiating a Cooperative Agreement
for further cleanup.
