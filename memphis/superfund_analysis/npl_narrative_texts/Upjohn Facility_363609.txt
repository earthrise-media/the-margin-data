NPL Site Narrative for Upjohn Facility
 
UPJOHN FACILITY
Barceloneta, Puerto Rico
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Upjohn Site in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, is the result of
a spill of 15,300 gallons of a mixture of 65 percent carbon tetrachloride and 35 percent acetonitrile. In
September 1982, a buried tank holding this mixture leaked, releasing its contents into ground water. EPA
and the U.S. Geological Survey have documented contamination of ground water. A large portion of the
spilled material remains in the soil. A public well serving more than 12,000 people is less than 1 mile from
the site.
 
Upjohn has taken a number of remedial measures at the site, including (1) installing a grid of monitoring
wells to define the plume of contaminated ground water; (2) installing a water line to the Puerto Rico
Aqueduct and Sewer Authority supply line to Tiborones; (3) providing emergency water supplies to
Garrochales; (4) cleaning, inspecting, and testing the remaining underground tanks (no other leaks
were found); and (5) installing a pilot extraction plant to remove the carbon tetrachloride from the soil.
Upjohn says it has already recovered 800 gallons of carbon tetrachloride from the soil by vapor extraction.
Upjohn plans to install an extraction well to recover a plume containing 2,000 parts per billion of carbon
tetrachloride.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is currently negotiating an agreement with Upjohn to ensure that the remedial
actions are completed in accordance with CERCLA requirements.
