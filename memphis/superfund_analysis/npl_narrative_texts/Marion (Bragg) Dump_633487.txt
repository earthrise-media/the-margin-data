NPL Site Narrative for Marion (Bragg)
Dump
 
MARION (BRAGG) DUMP
Marion, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Marion (Bragg) Dump covers 40 acres in Marion, Grant
County, Indiana. The area is relatively flat, with the Mississinewa River within 200 yards. The landfill,
originally an old gravel pit, was used for the disposal of various wastes until it was closed and covered
in 1975. The State reports that for at least 2 years, the landfill received approximately 1,400 drums per
month. At least 3,000 drums containing a variety of hazardous materials such as acetone, solvents,
plasticizers, lead, and cadmium may be buried.
 
Leachate has been observed on the southeast side of the landfill. The primary concern is the threat of
ground water contamination. Approximately 3,000 people live within 1 mile of the site and draw their water
from an aquifer 20 to 25 feet below the site. To date, contamination has not been detected in wells in the
immediate area.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
