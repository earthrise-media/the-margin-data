NPL Site Narrative for Waverly Ground
Water Contamination
 
WAVERLY GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Waverly, Nebraska
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Waverly (population 1,700) is on a terrace of Salt Creek
in Lancaster County, Nebraska. In the summer of 1982, the State, in cooperation with EPA, sampled the
city's municipal wells. Wells #1 and #3 were contaminated with chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and 1,2-
dichloroethane. Further study is needed to identify the source or sources responsible.
 
The city has discontinued use of Wells #1 and #3. Because the source of the contaminants migrating into
ground water is currently unknown, the remaining uncontaminated wells could be threatened. The city has
drilled a new Well #4 to replace the most heavily contaminated Well #1.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In August 1985, EPA started a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to
determine the source and extent of ground water contamination at Waverly and identify alternatives for
remedial action. Initial site evaluation and sampling analysis are underway to develop a RI/FS workplan. In
January 1986, EPA started a soil-gas survey.
