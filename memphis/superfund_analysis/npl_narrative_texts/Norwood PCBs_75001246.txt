NPL Site Narrative for Norwood PCBs
 
NORWOOD PCBS
Norwood, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Norwood PCBs Site is a privately owned industrial
site covering approximately 24 acres in a commercial/residential area of Norwood, Norfolk County,
Massachusetts. The property was developed for industrial use in the 1940s and was occupied by several
manufacturers of electrical components, including transformers that used PCBs as a dielectric fluid and
coolant. In June 1983, EPA and the State identified PCBs in surface soils at the site and secured the area
with guards. Also in June, EPA used $200,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to excavate approximately
518 cubic yards of contaminated soil and transport it to a regulated disposal facility.
 
Other contaminants, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and trichloroethylene, have been found
on the site in soils, surface water, ground water, and ambient air. Ground water in the area is used for
municipal, private, and industrial water supplies, according to a report of the U.S. Geological Survey.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The present owners of the site have initiated a lawsuit against former owners and
operators for site cleanup and damages. The lawsuit names EPA and the State as indispensable parties.
In December 1985, the State completed the initial remedial measure of fencing the site and covering
additional PCB-contaminated soil.
