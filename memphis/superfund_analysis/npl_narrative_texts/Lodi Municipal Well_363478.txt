NPL Site Narrative for Lodi Municipal Well
 
LODI MUNICIPAL WELL
Lodi, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Lodi Municipal Well in Lodi, Bergen County, New
Jersey, is contaminated with uranium and its decay products, according to tests conducted by the State.
In December 1983, the State closed the well, which was one of nine wells serving about 24,000 people.
Other municipal wells are being used, but they draw from the same aquifer. The State is investigating to
determine if ground water migrating from a nearby thorium-processing facility is contaminating the Lodi
Municipal Well.
 
Status (January 1986) : Additional tests of the well water are planned to determine if the radionuclides
present are associated with a naturally occurring formation in the area. The analyses will also include
nonradiological constituents, which are used to help identify the source of contamination.
 
Status (September 1988) : In the spring of 1988, EPA started a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/
FS), which should help determine if the contamination is naturally occurring.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : A draft of the RI/FS report was completed in December 1989. Additional
sampling is planned to determine if the radioactive contamination is naturally occurring.
