NPL Site Narrative for Metal Banks
 
METAL BANKS
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Metal Banks Site covers 6 acres in an urban/industrial
neighborhood next to the Delaware River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After processing transformers
and oil contaminated with PCBs there for a number of years, Metal Banks closed the operation in 1972.
In 1977, EPA determined that periodic oil slicks found in the Delaware River adjacent to the site were
contaminated with PCBs. The site was subsequently identified as the source of the slicks. A U.S. Coast
Guard study revealed that up to 20,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated oil were in the ground water under
the site and were leaking into the Delaware River.
 
Status (July 1983) : Negotiations are now in progress on a suit filed by EPA against Metal Banks in
1980. The company is currently pumping the contaminated ground water and treating it to remove the
contamination.
