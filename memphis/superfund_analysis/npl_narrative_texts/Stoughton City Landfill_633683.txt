NPL Site Narrative for Stoughton City
Landfill
 
STOUGHTON CITY LANDFILL
Stoughton, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The City of Stoughton owned and operated a solid waste
landfill from the mid-1950s until 1978 at the northeast edge of Stoughton in Dane County, Wisconsin. The
5-acre landfill was capped and seeded in 1978. Presently, it is roped off. Plans call for it to be used as a
city park after it is cleaned up.
 
From 1953 to 1963, the site took unknown amounts of wastes, which consisted primarily of solvents and
other liquid organic compounds, from a tire manufacturer. The soils in the area are moderately to highly
permeable, and the landfill did not have a liner or leachate collection system.
 
On November 17, 1983, the State sampled six on-site monitoring wells. The results showed elevated
levels of volatile organic compounds in three of the six wells. At present, the full extent of ground water
contamination is unknown. About 8,500 people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of
drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
