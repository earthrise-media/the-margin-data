NPL Site Narrative for Bayou Sorrel
 
BAYOU SORREL
Bayou Sorrel, Louisiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Bayou Sorrel Site covers 50 acres and is located 6 miles northwest
of Bayou Sorrel, Louisiana, in Iberville Parish. The site is on the East Atchafalaya Basin Floodway
Protection Levee, adjacent to the Upper Grand River and Pat Bayou. The site, active in the mid-1960s,
includes a number of burial cells, a landfarm, pits located near storage tanks, and a producing oil well.
Liquid wastes and sludges, as well as containerized wastes, are present. The operator closed the
site in 1979 under a court order obtained by the State with assistance from EPA. An evaluation of the
previous closure indicates that it was not totally successful. Organic odors are prevalent on-site, and cover
has eroded from some areas of the pits. During the closure attempt, some pits were covered with site
overburden rather than a less permeable clay. Soil, ground water, and possibly air are contaminated with
organic and inorganic pollutants.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
EPA deferred rulemaking on this site in September 1983 to allow more time for reviewing the comments
received and resolving technical issues related to its inclusion on the NPL. After further review and
investigative work, EPA placed the site on the NPL.
