NPL Site Narrative for Zellwood Ground
Water Contamination
 
ZELLWOOD GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Zellwood, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Zellwood Ground Water Contamination Site covers 5 acres
near Zellwood, an unincorporated town in rural central Florida. About 5,000 people use ground water in
the town, which is 1 mile east of the site. Ground water at the site is shallow and generally moves south to
southeast.
 
The primary source of the contamination is a series of lagoons where Drum Services, Inc., a drum recycler,
disposed of rinse water. Arsenic and other metals were found in wells on the Drum Services property
close to the lagoons. In November 1980, the lagoons were taken out of service. In August 1981, they were
drained and cleaned, and the sludges were taken to a nearby landfill. Drum Services now has a permit to
operate a drum reclamation furnace and therefore no longer generates rinse water.
 
Status (July 1983) : In mid-1982, EPA completed geophysical studies and installed and sampled
monitoring wells. EPA is currently reviewing the site report. EPA took additional samples at the site at the
end of 1982 but analytical results are not yet available. On a recent visit to the site, EPA's Emergency
Response Section found an additional drum disposal area.
