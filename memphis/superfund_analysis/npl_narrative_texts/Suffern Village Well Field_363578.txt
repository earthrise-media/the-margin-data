NPL Site Narrative for Suffern Village Well
Field
 
SUFFERN VILLAGE WELL FIELD
Village of Suffern, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Suffern Village Well Field consists of four wells in the
Village of Suffern, Rockland County, New York. Approximately 11,000 residents are served at an average
rate of 1.5 million gallons per day from the well field, which is immediately adjacent to the Ramapo River
in the northwest corner of the village limits. In September 1978, Rockland County Health Department
detected over 100 parts per billion (ppb) of the solvent 1,1,1-trichloroethane in Well Number 4. Three wells
(numbers 1, 2, and 4) have been forced out of operation due to the contamination.
 
During an investigation in 1979, the Health Department identified Tempcon Corp. as a likely source of
the solvent contamination. Tempcon has since removed its suspected dry well and no longer uses 1,1,1-
trichloroethane in its operations. Unfortunately, these remedial actions have not reduced the levels of
1,1,1-trichloroethane at the well field.
 
During the summer of 1979, the village took remedial action of its own by constructing a $190,000
pretreatment aeration system to remove volatile organic chemicals from the ground water and by pumping
upgradient Well Number 4 and discharging the effluent. These two remedial measures control the
concentration of 1,1,1-trichloroethane in Well Number 3 to below 50 ppb, which allows the well to be used.
The State has studied the Ramapo Valley outwash deposit, the 8,000-foot long aquifer tapped by the wells.
The State plans further studies of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
