NPL Site Narrative for Whitehall Municipal
Wells
 
WHITEHALL MUNICIPAL WELLS
Whitehall, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (December 30, 1982) : The Whitehall Municipal Wells provide water to residents
of Whitehall, Michigan. In January 1981, the State detected perchloroethylene (PCE) in Well Number 3.
The city stopped using the well and increased pumping rates at the other four municipal wells. Number 3
is used only on an emergency basis. In February 1981, two monitoring wells close to Well Number 3 were
found to be contaminated with high levels of trichloroethylene and cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, in addition to
low levels of PCE and 1,1-dichloroethane. Limited sampling detected the same chemicals in residential
wells northeast of Well Number 3. The several suspected sources of contamination are spread over a
relatively wide area because of uncertainty about the direction of ground water flow.
 
This site has sometimes been referred to as "Whitehall Well Field."
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : EPA recently installed five monitoring wells. Further activities are pending.
 
Status (February 11, 1991) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with the
State of Michigan, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
