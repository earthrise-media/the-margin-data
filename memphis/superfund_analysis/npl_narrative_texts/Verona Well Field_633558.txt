NPL Site Narrative for Verona Well Field
 
VERONA WELL FIELD
Battle Creek, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Verona Well Field covers 160 acres in Battle Creek, Michigan.
It supplies all water for the city's 35,000 residents, as well as several major food-producing industries in
the area. Of the 31 wells in the well field, 20 are contaminated with trichloroethylene and other volatile
hydrocarbons. These compounds are being introduced into the distribution system at low levels. Private
wells near the well field are also contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site. In
July 1983, EPA began providing bottled water to about 100 nearby residences and businesses with private
wells. This activity will cost about $20,000 until September 1983, when a State-funded program to extend a
water main is completed.
