NPL Site Narrative for Hastings Ground
Water Contamination
 
HASTINGS GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Hastings, Nebraska
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Hastings (population 23,580) is in Adams County, Nebraska.
Preliminary sampling of municipal wells in 1983 by the State detected contaminants in the ground water
beneath the old Hastings business district. Locally high concentrations of volatile organic chemicals
were detected. Past waste disposal practices, possibly dating to the 1920s, may have contributed to the
contamination. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control installed monitoring wells in Hastings
in 1984.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The city has shut down the most heavily contaminated municipal wells. Privately
owned public water supply wells located east of Hastings are also contaminated with organic solvents and
have been taken out of service.
 
EPA has prepared a workplan for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. As part of this effort, EPA is
sampling the monitoring wells on a quarterly schedule.
