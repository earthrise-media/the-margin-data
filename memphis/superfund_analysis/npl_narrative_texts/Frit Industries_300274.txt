NPL Site Narrative for Frit Industries
 
FRIT INDUSTRIES
Walnut Ridge, Arkansas
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Frit Industries manufactures fertilizers from chemical waste
materials on about 30 acres in Walnut Ridge, Lawrence County, Arkansas. Operations began in 1973. A
fire in 1979 led to run-off contaminated with heavy metals. Operations at the site have caused further run-
off problems, possible ground water contamination, and air pollution.
 
Status (July 1983) : Since December 1981, Frit has been studying run-off, the potential for ground water
contamination, and the buildup of heavy metals in the sediments of drainage ditches and Coon Creek. The
company submits reports to the State and EPA for comment and has proposed a cleanup plan involving a
plant for treating run-off.
 
In February 1983, EPA issued an Administrative Order requiring the company to perform an investigation
at the site and conduct any remedial activities necessary.
