NPL Site Narrative for Dixie Caverns
County Landfill
 
DIXIE CAVERNS COUNTY LANDFILL
Salem, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : Dixie Caverns County Landfill covers 27 acres in Salem,
Roanoke County, Virginia. Roanoke County operated the landfill from 1955 to 1976, accepting municipal
refuse, industrial sludge, nonhalogenated solvents, and other wastes.
 
In 1983, EPA observed uncontrolled leachate from the site entering local streams. In subsequent site
investigations, EPA identified an uncontrolled pile of emission control dust from an electric steel furnace.
The pile consists of an estimated 1,700 cubic yards of dust. The dust, which is migrating via surface
drainage, contains high levels of lead and cadmium, according to EPA. Also on-site are numerous drums
and a sludge pit.
 
Conditions at the site threaten ground water and surface water. An estimated 2,100 people draw drinking
water from private wells within 3 miles of the site. Dixie Caverns, a tourist attraction, is located 1 mile
downstream of the site.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : Using CERCLA emergency funds, EPA is cleaning up the drum disposal area
and the sludge pit. The removal is nearing completion. Cleanup of the dust pile started in August 1989.
 
EPA's preliminary plan for fiscal year 1990 includes a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine
the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
