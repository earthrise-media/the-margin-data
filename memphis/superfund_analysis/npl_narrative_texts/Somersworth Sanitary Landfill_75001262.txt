Somersworth, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Somersworth Sanitary Landfill covers 24 acres in
Somersworth, New Hampshire. Originally, the town burned residential, commercial, and industrial wastes
on the site. In 1950, the dump was converted to a sanitary landfill. Unknown quantities of sludges,
solvents, acids, dyes, metals, laboratory or pharmaceutical wastes, and potash were deposed of at this
site. Both surface water and ground water are contaminated. On-site monitoring wells detected moderate
levels of carbon tetrachloride, ethyl benzene, toluene, and metals. Leachate was observed at the eastern
edge of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. EPA and the State are negotiating a
Cooperative Agreement for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. At the same time, EPA is completing
a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
