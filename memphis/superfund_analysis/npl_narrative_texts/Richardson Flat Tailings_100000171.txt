NPL Site Narrative for Richardson Flat
Tailings
 
RICHARDSON FLAT TAILINGS
Summit County, Utah
 
 
The Richardson Flat Tailings site covers approximately 160 acres in a valley 1.5 miles northeast of
Park City, Summit County, Utah. One source of hazardous substances on the site is a tailings dam and
associated tailings materials that came from the Keetley Ontario Mine and other metal mining operations
currently owned by United Park City Mines (UPCM). The most recent use of the area for tailings disposal
was during 1975-81, when UPCM leased its mining properties to either Park City Ventures or Noranda
Mining, Inc. The two companies constructed and operated milling facilities on UPCM properties.
 
A second source is a 6-acre "flood plains tailing pile" immediately west of the tailings pond on the banks of
Silver Creek. Historical aerial photos show that the pile was in existence as early as 1953. During 1989-90,
EPA and the State observed tailings slumping into an on-site diversion ditch and Silver Creek. The tailings
contain arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, silver, and zinc, according to EPA tests conducted in
1985 and 1989. The State classifies Silver Creek as a cold water fishery. Wetlands border the creek and
diversion ditch. Water from the creek is diverted to irrigate approximately 300 acres of pastureland.
 
High-volume air sampling at the site in 1986 documented that arsenic, cadmium, lead, and zinc were
released to the air. An estimated 4,500 people live within 4 miles of the site.
 
This site was proposed to the NPL on June 24, 1988 (55 FR 23988) on the on the basis of a score above
the 28.50 cutoff on the original Hazard Ranking System (HRS). In response to public comment, the score
fell to below the cutoff, and the site was dropped from consideration for the NPL on February 11, 1991 (56
FR 5598). It is being proposed at this time on the basis of its score on the revised HRS. New information
was used to evaluate the surface water migration pathway, which is scored differently under the two
systems.
