NPL Site Narrative for Wheeler Pit
 
WHEELER PIT
La Prairie Township, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Wheeler Pit covers 4 acres near Janesville, Wisconsin. The
unlined gravel pit, owned by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad, is about 30 feet above
ground water in 200 feet of permeable soils. Wastes were accepted from 1956 until 1974. From 1960 to
1974, General Motors (GM) used the site to dispose of paint sludges and fly ash from its Janesville auto
assembly plant. GM indicates that about 22.3 million gallons of organic and inorganic sludges containing
solvents and heavy metals were disposed of in the gravel pit. It was closed, covered, regraded, and
seeded in 1975.
 
Sampling by GM established that ground water under the site is contaminated with arsenic, chromium,
zinc, and barium. Six private and industrial wells for drinking water in the area are contaminated.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
