NPL Site Narrative for South Point Plant
 
SOUTH POINT PLANT
South Point, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The South Point Plant covers 75 acres on the Ohio River
floodplain in South Point, Lawrence County, Ohio. From 1943 to 1979, Allied Chemical produced ammonia,
urea, nitrogen fertilizer, melamine, and formaldehyde at the site. During operations, several landfills and
surface impoundments were used for disposal of process wastes. An extraordinary number of leaks and
spills in production areas, plus run-off from a large fire, have contaminated the aquifer under the site with
nitrates and ammonia, according to analyses conducted by the State. The South Point well field is near the
plant and is in jeopardy. Contaminants also have reached the Ohio River where Ashland, Kentucky, draws
its water.
 
The present owner, Ashland Chemical, is monitoring the production wells on-site.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
