the company operated, on the south portion of the site, a coal-tar refining and wood-treatment facility using
creosote. On-site are a trench, landfill, and lagoons used to dispose of wastes containing pyridine, a toxic
organic chemical. Citizens have complained frequently of headaches, general ill health, and increased
cancer and birth defects. Ground water is contaminated with pyridine, according to analyses conducted by
