Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Forest Waste Products Site is in Otisville, Genesee County,
Michigan. From 1972 to 1978, it was licensed by the State to operate an industrial landfill and receive liquid
industrial wastes. The site did not screen incoming wastes properly and accepted toxic materials such as
polybrominated biphenyls and C-66. Oils, PCBs, and plating wastes were buried in drums or dumped into
surface impoundments. PCBs, copper, and zinc have been detected in ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
