NPL Site Narrative for Woodstock
Municipal Landfill
 
WOODSTOCK MUNICIPAL LANDFILL
Woodstock, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Woodstock Municipal Landfill covers 40 to 50 acres in
Woodstock, McHenry County, Illinois. The site was an open dump prior to 1969, when the city started
burying municipal/industrial wastes in trenches. The city estimates that approximately 7,200 cubic yards of
nickel sludge generated by the Autolite Plant in Woodstock were disposed at the landfill during 1972-76.
The landfill ceased accepting waste after 1976 and in 1980 was placed on the "closed and covered" list of
the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.
 
During a March 1985 inspection, EPA observed leachate seeping at the site. Soil near the seepage
contained cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, arsenic, and nickel. Underlying the site are layers of
permeable sand and gravel, facilitating movement of contaminants into ground water. An estimated 12,400
people obtain drinking water from public and private wells within 3 miles of the site, including the City of
Woodstock's six wells.
 
The site is unfenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact with leachate
seeps.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
