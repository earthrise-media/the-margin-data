NPL Site Narrative for New London
Submarine Base
 
NEW LONDON SUBMARINE BASE
New London, Connecticut
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : The New London Submarine Base covers 1,412 acres on
the east bank of the Thames River, New London, New London County, Connecticut. The area around
the base is mixed industrial, commercial, and residential property. Established in 1916, the base serves
primarily as an operation and support base for submarine activities in the Atlantic Ocean.
 
The base is participating in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), established in 1978. Under this
program, the Department of Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination from
hazardous materials. Under IRP, the Navy has identified 16 potential hazardous waste disposal areas and
has extensively studied three areas.
 
From 1957 to 1973, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, PCBs, spent battery acids, and other waste
were buried below the water table in the 25-acre Area A Landfill, located on base wetlands. The second
area currently being investigated is the Defense Property Disposal Operations area, which was used as
a burning ground and landfill from 1950 to 1969. The third area is the Over Bank Disposal Area, which
operated from 1957 to the 1970s.
 
According to Navy tests conducted in 1984, sediment and surface water in and around Area A are
contaminated with lead, cadmium, 4,4-DDD, and 4,4-DDT. Ground water in some areas is as shallow as
10 feet below the surface, and soils are permeable. These conditions potentially threaten ground water,
which provides drinking water to 3,500 to 5,000 people within 3 miles of the base.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : EPA plans to negotiate an Interagency Agreement with the Navy under
CERCLA Section 120 to cover the remedial activities to be conducted.
