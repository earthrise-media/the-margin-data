NPL Site Narrative for Craig Farm Drum
 
CRAIG FARM DRUM
Parker, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Craig Farm Drum site in Parker, Pennsylvania, is a
combination of several areas totaling 8 to 10 acres located on one property owned by a chemical
manufacturer. Five sites (number 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, and a lagoon) have been investigated. From 1958 to 1963,
Site 2, which is of most concern, was used for disposal of drums of hydroxydiphenyl wastes. Subsequently,
the drums were covered with dirt. Ground water contamination is of the greatest concern. Also, a stream
draining the site and flowing to the Allegheny River shows signs of contamination by the wastes.
 
Status (July 1983) : As a result of negotiations with the State, the responsible party has agreed to make
a study of the site. The study began in April 1983 and is scheduled to be completed late in the year. It will
identify the wastes present, estimate the amounts, examine any contamination leaving the site, estimate
the environmental effects, and assess remedial measures necessary to clean up the site. The study
involves monitoring of ground water and testing throughout the site.
