NPL Site Narrative for Bowers Landfill
 
BOWERS LANDFILL
Circleville, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Bowers Landfill, also known as Island Road Landfill, covers
80 acres about 1 mile north of Circleville, Ohio, within the Scioto River floodplain. The site is situated
over a very productive aquifer (capable of yields of 1,000 gallons per minute) that supplies both industrial
and domestic water. In 1958, a gravel pit started operations on the site. Shortly thereafter, a landfilling
operation started in which soil from the nearby pit was used to cover refuse dumped on top of the existing
surface. Little is known of the initial years of the landfill, but from 1963 to 1968, it accepted organic and
inorganic chemicals and general domestic and industrial refuse. In response to a Congressional inquiry,
two local chemical manufacturers stated that in excess of 7,500 tons of chemical waste (physical state
and concentrations unknown) had been disposed of at this site. In July 1980, EPA identified toluene and
ethylbenzene in water from the landfill. The State worked with the current owner, who hired an engineering
firm to evaluate the site. The State reviewed the report and asked for additional information.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State reviewed the additional information from the owner and is awaiting the final
Remedial Action Master Plan EPA is preparing. It will outline the investigations needed to determine the full
extent of cleanup required at the site.
