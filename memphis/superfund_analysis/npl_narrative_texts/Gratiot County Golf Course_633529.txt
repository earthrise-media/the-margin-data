NPL Site Narrative for Gratiot County Golf
Course
 
GRATIOT COUNTY GOLF COURSE
St. Louis, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (December 30, 1982) : The Gratiot County Golf Course covers 3 acres in St.
Louis, Michigan. From 1956 until August 1970, the Michigan Chemical Corp. (later purchased by Velsicol
Chemical Corp.) burned and disposed of industrial waste (including DDT) on-site. Hazardous waste
seeped and ran off into the Pine River.
 
During 1982, Velsicol cleaned up the site under supervision of the State. In November 1982, Velsicol
agreed to a $38.5 million combined settlement for cleanup of this site and two other NPL sites in Michigan
-- Gratiot County Landfill and the Velsicol Chemical Corp. (Michigan) site in St. Louis.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Michigan, has determined that responsible or other parties have implemented all appropriate
response action required.
