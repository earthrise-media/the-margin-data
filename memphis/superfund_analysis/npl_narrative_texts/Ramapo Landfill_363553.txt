NPL Site Narrative for Ramapo Landfill
 
RAMAPO LANDFILL
Ramapo, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Ramapo Landfill covers 45 acres in Ramapo, Rockland
County, New York. It opened in 1972. In 1978, the State denied the operators a permit because of an
incomplete permit application and violations of State codes. The facility received sludge from a cosmetic
company, and midnight dumping may have occurred. In 1980, about 50 drums containing an unknown
waste were observed on the site. Leachate from the site is contaminating Torne Brook, a tributary to the
Ramapo River. Monitoring wells around the facility have detected various pollutants, including toluene,
xylene, and methylene chloride. Wells providing water for the Spring Valley Water Co. are close to the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has entered into a Consent Agreement with the Town of Ramapo, the site
owner, to clean up the site. EPA will evaluate the provisions of the Consent Agreement by conducting a
Remedial Action Master Plan, which will outline the investigations needed to determine the full extent of
cleanup required at the site.
