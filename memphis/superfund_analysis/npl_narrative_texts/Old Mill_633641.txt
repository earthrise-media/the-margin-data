OLD MILL
Rock Creek, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Old Mill Site in Rock Creek, Ashtabula County, Ohio,
consists of two adjacent areas: a former potting soil processing operation (1 acre) and a drum storage area
(5 acres). About 1,400 drums of flammable hazardous substances, including resins, solvents, oils, and
aqueous/acid materials, accumulated at the site. In 1980, the owner filed for bankruptcy. PCBs have been
detected on the site, which is close to a school and several houses. The possibility of fire or explosion is a
concern.
 
This site was first listed under the name "Rock Creek/Jack Webb."
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA negotiated with responsible parties for removal of about 550 drums. EPA
removed the remaining drums and 80 cubic yards of contaminated soils using $110,000 in CERCLA
emergency funds.
