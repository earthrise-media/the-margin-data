NPL Site Narrative for Sand, Gravel and
Stone
 
SAND, GRAVEL AND STONE
Elkton, Maryland
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Sand, Gravel, & Stone Site is an inactive quarry near Elkton,
Cecil County, Maryland. From 1969 to 1974, approximately 3 acres of the site, which is privately owned,
were used for the disposal of bulk wastes (processing waste water, sludge still bottoms) and about 90
drums of solid and semisolid waste. Pits were excavated and used for disposal of approximately 700,000
gallons of waste. In 1975 and 1976, in response to orders from the State, the owner removed 200,000
gallons of liquid waste from the site and buried drums and sludges on the site in clay-lined pits. In May
1982, EPA noted contamination of surface water as well as localized contamination of ground water at the
site. Water samples collected from homes within 0.3 mile of the site were not contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has taken enforcement action against a party potentially responsible for
wastes at the site. EPA recently completed a draft Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide future actions at the site.
