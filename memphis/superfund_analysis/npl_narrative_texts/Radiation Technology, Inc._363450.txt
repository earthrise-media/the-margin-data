NPL Site Narrative for Radiation
Technology, Inc.
 
RADIATION TECHNOLOGY, INC.
Rockaway Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Radiation Technology, Inc., manufactures plastics on a 15-
acre site close to Lake Denmark in Rockaway Township, Morris County, New Jersey. The area is totally
dependent upon ground water for drinking supplies. Analyses by the State indicate that ground water is
contaminated by plasticizers and chlorinated solvents, which were released through dumping of wastes or
burial of drums. These pollutants also pose a threat to nearby streams and Lake Denmark.
 
Two on-site wells were condemned by the local health department in March 1981, and the State issued
directives of various types in 1981 instructing the company to remedy the situation. When the company did
not comply, the State filed a Verified Complaint and Order to Show Cause in March 1982. On July 7, 1983,
the State issued a Consent Order requiring the company to monitor ground water to determine the source
of contamination.
 
Status (June 1984) : The monitoring program continues.
