NPL Site Narrative for Hagen Farm
 
HAGEN FARM
Stoughton, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : Hagen Farm covers 5 acres in the rural area southeast of
Stoughton, Dane County, Wisconsin. The site is a former gravel pit that accepted wastes during 1950-60
without a permit. An investigation conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR)
in 1982 discovered approximately 5,000 uncovered sealed drums of waste material. In 1984, WDNR
detected xylene, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethylbenzene, vinyl chloride, and other organic solvents in
monitoring wells at the site.
 
Private wells within 3 miles of the farm supply drinking water for an estimated 940 people. The majority of
Stoughton's 7,500 residents draw water from the municipal wells within 3 miles of the farm.
 
In 1983, the Wisconsin Department of Justice filed an enforcement action against Uniroyal, Inc., and Waste
Management of Wisconsin, Inc., asking for investigation and cleanup of the site. The case is pending.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA has sent general notice letters to individuals and parties potentially
responsible for wastes associated with the site informing them of their potential liability. EPA is now
negotiating with them to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent
of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
