NPL Site Narrative for Cosden Chemical
Coatings Corp.
 
COSDEN CHEMICAL COATINGS CORP.
Beverly, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : Cosden Chemical Coatings Corp. manufactures paints on
an 8.8-acre site in Beverly, Burlington County, New Jersey. The site is 300 feet from a residential area and
4,000 feet from the Delaware River.
 
In numerous site inspections, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has
found large amounts of soil contaminated from excessive spillage and leaking drums. About 700 drums
containing paint waste and solvents, including toluene and ethylbenzene, have also been found on-site.
Recent analyses conducted by the State found PCBs contaminating much of this waste. In February 1985,
NJDEP secured the site by consolidating the contents of the drums into roll-off dumpsters. In spring 1986,
NJDEP removed 540 drums of PCB wastes and sent them to an EPA-approved incinerator for disposal.
 
An estimated 69,000 people depend on ground water within 3 miles of the site for their drinking water.
Three municipal wells are within 1 mile of the site. Site soils are highly permeable, which facilitates
movement of contaminants into ground water.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : In February 1987, NJDEP removed 43 drums of paint and paint sludges for
incineration.
