NEAL'S LANDFILL (BLOOMINGTON)
Bloomington, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Neal's Landfill covers about 18 acres 4.5 miles west of
Bloomington, Indiana. The site was used as an industrial and municipal waste landfill from 1950 to 1972.
The main fill area measures about 300 by 300 yards. Later, the landfill was used as pasture for beef cattle.
A number of springs surface near the site and flow 0.8 mile to Richland Creek, a tributary of the White
River.
 
In 1966 and 1967, capacitors and arrestors containing PCBs, as well as PCB-contaminated capacitor
insulation material, rags, and filter clay, were disposed of at the landfill. Capacitors and other contaminated
materials are visible on the surface. PCBs have been found in the surface soils in the northeast portion of
the landfill, the springs near the site, sediments of Richland Creek, and fat from a calf that had grazed on
the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : On January 4, 1983, the United States filed a lawsuit against Westinghouse under
CERCLA and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive
relief. Negotiations as to settlement of a preliminary injunction motion are continuing. The main case is set
for trial on October 25, 1983.
