NPL Site Narrative for Myers Property
 
MYERS PROPERTY
Franklin Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Myers Property covers 2 to 3 acres in a rural area in Franklin
Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey. The site, currently an auto repair shop, previously contained
various commercial facilities that produced pesticides. Several drums and asbestos materials are stored
in buildings on the site. One well on the property supplies drinking water. The State recommended that it
be closed because it is contaminated by various volatile organic chemicals. The site borders Cakepoulin
Creek. A spring surfaces on the property and flows into the creek toward a State wildlife refuge.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has proposed removing the drums stored on site and is negotiating a
Cooperative Agreement with EPA for the surface cleanup.
