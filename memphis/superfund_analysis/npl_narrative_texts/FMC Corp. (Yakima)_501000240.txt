NPL Site Narrative for FMC Corp. (Yakima)
 
FMC CORP. (YAKIMA)
Yakima, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The FMC Corp. Site covers about 4 acres in Yakima,
Washington. From 1952 to 1959, FMC and other firms disposed of agricultural pesticides in a "poison
pit" on FMC's property. The unlined pit contains at least 44 cubic yards of mixed chemicals and residues,
and the surrounding soil appears contaminated. A high potential exists for contamination of ground water,
which supplies residential wells in the area.
 
Status (July 1983) : Samples of soil were taken in June 1983. Results are expected soon. The State is
working with FMC to determine what other actions are needed and to schedule them.
