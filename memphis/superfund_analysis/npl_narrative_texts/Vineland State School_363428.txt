NPL Site Narrative for Vineland State
School
 
VINELAND STATE SCHOOL
Vineland, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Vineland State School in Vineland, Cumberland County,
New Jersey, operated an unregulated incinerator and landfill on-site for disposal of its wastes. Between the
1950s and mid-1960s, 6,000 to 8,000 quart cans of mercury-based pesticide were dumped in a pit near
the incinerator. The incinerator has since been disassembled, and the pit filled and graded. The landfill is
also reported to contain pesticides. The homes nearest to the underground dump depend on the Cohansey
Aquifer for water.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has installed three monitoring wells, which detected arsenic above the water
quality standard. The State has discovered three additional disposal areas at the school: another pesticide
dump, an area where PCBs from the school's transformers were dumped, and an old landfill. Analysis of
soils near the spill detected 10 to 67 parts per million PCBs. The State is also sampling three of the eight
private wells on the site.
 
EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full
extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
