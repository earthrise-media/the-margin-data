NPL Site Narrative for Des Moines TCE
 
DES MOINES TCE
Des Moines, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Des Moines TCE site consists of a plume of ground water
contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) southwest of downtown Des Moines, Iowa, along the Raccoon
River. EPA installed several monitoring wells to locate the source or sources of the chemical, centering its
initial investigation around the Dico Co. TCE was first detected in ground water beneath the Dico property
in 1978. Dico used TCE to degrease metal parts and in the past spread the oily wastes from this process
on its property to control dust. Early in 1979, the company voluntarily stopped this procedure.
 
This site was first listed under the name "Dico."
 
Status (July 1983) : Recently, EPA reconfirmed TCE at Dico but is investigating other potential sources
as well. Also, EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
