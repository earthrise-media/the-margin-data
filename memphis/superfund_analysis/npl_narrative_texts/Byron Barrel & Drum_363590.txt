NPL Site Narrative for Byron Barrel &
Drum
 
BYRON BARREL & DRUM
Byron, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Byron Barrel & Drum Site covers 5 acres in an old
gravel and sand pit area in Byron Township, Genesee County, New York. It is adjacent to farm land used
for raising vegetables. About 200 55-gallon drums have been abandoned on the property. Based on
affidavits of several former employees, there may be an area where about 200 damaged drums are buried.
 
The State collected random samples from 11 of the drums at the site; the results indicate the presence of
various organic compounds, including toluene, methyl ethyl ketone, and methylene chloride. EPA sampled
all the drums at the site and found PCBs in several of them in concentrations up to 236 parts per million.
 
EPA issued an Administrative Order requiring the property owner to take immediate corrective actions to
clean up the site. The owner has not complied with the order.
 
About 20 people draw drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Using CERCLA emergency funds, EPA removed all the drums, sampled soils,
and installed a monitoring well. The results of the sampling indicate that both soil and ground water are
contaminated with volatile organic compounds.
