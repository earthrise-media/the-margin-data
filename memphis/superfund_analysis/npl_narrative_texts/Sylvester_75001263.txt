NPL Site Narrative for Sylvester
 
SYLVESTER
Nashua, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Sylvester (Gilson Road) Site covers 20 acres in a residential
area of Nashua, New Hampshire. During the 1970s, a 6-acre former sand/gravel pit became a dump for
household refuse, demolition materials, chemical sludges, and hazardous liquids. High concentrations of
heavy metals and organic chemicals contaminate the underlying ground water, which formed a plume that
moved rapidly toward Lyle Reed Brook. The brook is a tributary of the Nashua River, which is a source of
drinking water.
 
The dumping at the site was first discovered in late 1970. After several court appearances and court
actions, an injunction was issued in 1976 to remove all material from the site. However, operations
continued, and in November 1978, State personnel observed drums being sorted at the site. A court order
was issued in October 1979 prohibiting all further disposal of hazardous wastes on the site.
 
Between June 1980 and June 1982, EPA, first under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act and later
under CERCLA, installed a system to temporarily pump and recirculate contaminated ground water,
thus preventing it from reaching Lyle Reed Brook, preventing further contamination of the aquifer, and
controlling air pollution by volatile chemicals. The total cost was $925,000. In 1980, the city and the State
also contributed to fencing of site, removal of 1,300 drums, and installation of alternate water supply lines.
 
In August 1981, EPA awarded a $2,305,600 Cooperative Agreement to New Hampshire for (1) design
and construction of a slurry wall and cap to permanently contain contaminated ground water on-site, (2)
a feasibility study to evaluate alternatives for treating contaminated ground water, (3) design of the cost-
effective treatment system, and (4) extension of a municipal water system to serve residents whose wells
would become contaminated within 12 months.
 
This is the top priority site in New Hampshire.
 
Status (July 1983) : In June 1982, EPA amended the Cooperative Agreement to award an additional
$2,064,940 to (1) construct a larger (20-acre) slurry wall than originally planned (completed in December
1982) and (2) conduct pilot studies to develop design specifications for the ground water treatment system.
The pilot studies were completed in the second quarter of 1983. The Cooperative Agreement will be
amended to provide funds for construction of the treatment system, which is expected to operate for 2
years.
