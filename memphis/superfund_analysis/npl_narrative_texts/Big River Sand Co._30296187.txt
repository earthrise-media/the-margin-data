NPL Site Narrative for Big River Sand Co.
 
BIG RIVER SAND CO.
Wichita, Kansas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Big River Sand Co. Site covers 80 acres in northwest
Wichita, Sedgwick County, Kansas. During the early to mid 1970s, the previous owner/operator of the site
allowed approximately 1,800 drums of paint-related wastes to be deposited on the property at the edge of
a 5-acre sand pit lake.
 
In 1982, a county court order was issued requiring the previous owner to remove the drums and transfer
them to his own property adjacent to the sand pit lake area. After approximately 200 drums had been
transferred, the State, notified of the removal by the county, asked that the work cease because the
workers lacked personal protective equipment. Later, the drums remaining at the sand pit lake area and
their contents were either recycled or disposed of by the previous owner in a satisfactory manner. In
August 1984, he removed 200 deteriorating drums from his property. The site includes both the sand pit
lake area and the adjacent property where the remaining drums were located. Monitoring by the State in
1982 and 1984 detected solvents and heavy metals in nearby residential wells. About 1,000 people use
wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and to identify alternatives for remedial action.
