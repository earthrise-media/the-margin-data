NPL Site Narrative for Perham Arsenic

PERHAM ARSENIC SITE
Perham, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Perham Arsenic Site is a small burial area covering about
0.25 acre in Perham, Minnesota. It was discovered in 1972 when employees from a land construction
company were poisoned by arsenic in the company's well. The State did extensive sampling of soil and
ground water, which helped to define the boundaries of the site and to establish the extent and magnitude
of ground water contamination. The source of the contamination is apparently the remains of a program
in the 1930s and 1940s to control grasshopper infestations. There are probably 25 sites in Minnesota
where arsenic-containing materials are buried and another 50 to 100 where they are stored aboveground.
The arsenic issue remained dormant, except for monitoring of wells, until the late 1970s. Public concern
with hazardous waste renewed efforts by the State to resolve the issue. The State has concluded that the
arsenic and contaminated soil must be excavated to solve the ground water problem.
 
In May 1982, the City capped the site with a plastic film and soil to limit infiltration of rain and snow into the
wastes.
 
Status (June 1984) : A remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the
site has been completed. A feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action is scheduled to be
completed in the summer of 1984.
