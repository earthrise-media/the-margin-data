Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Mica Landfill covers 180 acres near Mica in Spokane

A monitoring well at the landfill has shown contamination with 1,1,1-trichloroethylene, chloroform, and
several other organic compounds, according to analyses conducted by a consultant to Spokane County.
The extent of ground water contamination is unknown at this time.
 
The county has sampled all domestic and agricultural wells within 1 mile and reviewed its records to
identify the quantities and types of waste known or suspected of being buried at the landfill. About 425
people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water. Eight irrigation wells are
within 3 miles of the site.
