NPL Site Narrative for Coleman-Evans
Wood Preserving Co.
 
COLEMAN-EVANS WOOD PRESERVING CO.
Whitehouse, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Coleman-Evans Wood Preserving Co. Site covers 11 acres
in Whitehouse, Florida, about 8 miles west of Jacksonville. Since 1950, the facility has treated wood
with pentachlorophenol (PCP). It discharged its waste waters into unlined pits, which were later covered.
Currently, waste water enters a water/oil separator. Sludge settles out, and the liquid is recycled back to
the plant. Sludge is removed every 90 days to an approved disposal site.
 
Shallow ground water in the residential area adjacent to the site is contaminated with PCP. Residents
depend on private wells for their drinking water. A public water supply is not available. In 1980, EPA
installed wells to monitor ground water on the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State signed a Consent Order in December 1982 with the company for a remedial
investigation at the site. The investigation will include a hydrogeological assessment and a determination of
the extent of off-site contamination. First round of data is due in July 1983.
