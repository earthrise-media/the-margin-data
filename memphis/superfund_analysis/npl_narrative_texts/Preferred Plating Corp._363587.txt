NPL Site Narrative for Preferred Plating
Corp.
 
PREFERRED PLATING CORP.
Farmingdale, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Preferred Plating Corp. conducted plating operations on a
0.5-acre site in Farmingdale, Town of Babylon, Suffolk County, New York, for more than 20 years, before
going out of business in 1976. Since then, several firms have occupied the site. None conducted similar
operations to Preferred Plating. An automobile repair shop now occupies the site.
 
From 1955 to 1976, the Suffolk County Department of Health made numerous tests of waste materials
contained in open pits. The pits were severely cracked and leaking, allowing discharges into ground water.
In 1975, the county identified four major contaminants--copper, chromium, cadmium, and hexavalent
chromium. About 15,000 people draw drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
The county has taken various court actions through the years to upgrade on-site treatment facilities. The
court mandates were never accomplished. In 1976, Preferred Plating filed for bankruptcy.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
