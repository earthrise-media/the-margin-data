Well Field
 
ADRIAN MUNICIPAL WELL FIELD
Adrian, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The municipal well field supplying water to the 11,000
residents of Adrian, Nobles County, Minnesota, is contaminated with volatile halogenated and
nonhalogenated organic chemicals, according to tests conducted by the State. The source is unknown.
The State has closed the two most highly contaminated city wells because of the health risk of benzene
and cis-1,2-dichloroethane. The city is now using two uncontaminated wells previously slated to be
abandoned due to age and low capacity.
 
The State is conducting a study to determine the source of contamination and develop a long-term solution
to the problem.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State is planning for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action.
 
The city has installed one new well upgradient of the site.
