NPL Site Narrative for Tibbetts Road
 
TIBBETTS ROAD
Barrington, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : The Tibbetts Road Site occupies approximately 1.9 acres
in the Town of Barrington, Strafford County, New Hampshire. It is in a residential area upgradient from
Swains Lake, which is used for recreational activities. The site was used for surface storage of 336
deteriorating drums collected from 1946 to 1958. PCBs, benzene, acetone, toluene, and other solvents
were present in the drums, according to EPA. Soil and ground water, including residential drinking water
wells serving approximately 20 people, are contaminated with benzene, trichloroethylene, toluene, methyl
ethyl ketone, and xylenes, according to tests conducted by the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution
Control Commission. About 2,100 people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site for drinking water. No
alternative source is available. A wetland is less than 1 mile from the site.
 
In April 1984, EPA used CERCLA emergency funds to remove all drums containing hazardous substances
from the site and dispose of them at an EPA-regulated disposal facility.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : During the summer of 1985, EPA and the State conducted a hydrogeologic study
to determine the need for additional removal activities. During the study, low levels of dioxin were detected
in the soil. Additional removal response is planned.
