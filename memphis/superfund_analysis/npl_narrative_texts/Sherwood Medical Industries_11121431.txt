Industries
 
SHERWOOD MEDICAL INDUSTRIES
Deland, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Sherwood Medical Industries manufactures medical equipment
in Deland, Florida. Over a period of 4 to 5 years, the company disposed of about 2 tons of liquid and
sludge, primarily contaminated with potassium chromates, into an unlined surface impoundment. The
impoundment is in the shallow aquifer overlying the Floridan Aquifer, which supplies water for numerous
private and public wells near the site, including the city of Deland's water supply well.
 
Status (July 1983) : Sherwood Medical installed a waste water treatment facility that enables its discharge
to meet Florida's Drinking Water Standards for chromium. The company is also pumping ground water
from the shallow aquifer to its treatment system. The company is in interim status under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act.
 
The State has recommended monitoring for nickel and halogenated solvents before deciding on the
significance of water quality problems at the facility.
