ROBINTECH, INC./NATIONAL PIPE CO.
Town of Vestal, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Robintech, Inc./National Pipe Co. Site is an inactive
filled lagoon, approximately 1 acre in size, in a primarily industrial area of the Town of Vestal, Broome
County, New York. The site was owned by Robinson Technical Products from September 1966 to 1970;
Robintech, Inc., from 1970 to December 1982; and National Pipe Co. from December 1982 to the present.
The facility manufactures polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe from inert PVC resin and assembles plastic-coated
cable.
 
The lagoon was used from 1968 to 1974 for disposal of chromic acid plating solution, caustic reverse
plating etch, machine cutting oils, and toluene. More than 1,500 gallons of liquid waste were dumped into
the lagoon, which had been a small swamp. It has been almost completely filled with clean dirt and paved
or covered with gravel. It is now used as a storage yard for PVC pipe.
 
The site is situated at the southern edge of an area that is an active gravel pit on the southern bank of a
meander of the Susquehanna River. The area immediately north of the site is marshy, with a small stream
running through it that receives drainage from the Roundtop Hill area. The Town of Vestal Water District
No. 4 is on the Susquehanna floodplain about 2,500 feet north-northwest of the site. Well 4-2 was placed
on the NPL in September 1983.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
