NPL Site Narrative for Pristine, Inc.
 
PRISTINE, INC.
Reading, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Pristine, Inc., Site covers 3 acres in Reading, Ohio.
It borders on a railroad track with an adjacent trailer park and on the well field supplying Reading's
water. Between November 1974 and June 1980, an incinerator for liquid wastes operated on the site.
In April 1979, an inspection revealed the presence of 8,000 to 10,000 drums and 13 bulk storage tanks
containing a wide variety of hazardous substances. Soil was contaminated, and there was the potential for
contamination of ground water and surface water as well as for fires and explosions.
 
After the facility closed in June 1980 as a result of State enforcement actions, responsible parties reduced
the wastes to 15 drums and some bulk wastes. Threats posed by the facility have been greatly reduced,
but contaminated run-off to Mill Creek may still be a problem.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
