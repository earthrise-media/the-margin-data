NPL Site Narrative for SCRDI Dixiana
 
SCRDI DIXIANA
Cayce, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The South Carolina Recycling and Disposal, Inc. (SCRDI) Dixiana
Site covers 2 acres near Cayce, South Carolina. At one time, the site contained over 1,100 drums of
materials such as paints, solvents, acids, waste oils, phenols, and dyes. In August 1978, the State filed a
suit against the site owners. The resulting court order specified that the site no longer receive wastes and
that the wastes on-site be contained. In May 1980, as a result of SCRDI's failure to contain the wastes, a
State court found SCRDI in contempt, which resulted in the company being placed in receivership. Shortly
thereafter, SCRDI removed all drums and some contaminated soil.
 
As a result of spillage of a dye (suspected carcinogen), shallow ground water is contaminated, and the
State advised two families living nearby not to use their well water.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through a State enforcement
action against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
