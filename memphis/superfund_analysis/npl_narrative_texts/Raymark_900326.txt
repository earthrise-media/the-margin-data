NPL Site Narrative for Raymark
 
RAYMARK
Hatboro, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Raymark Site covers 7 acres on Jacksonville Road in
the Borough of Hatboro, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Penn Rivet and Machine Co. owned the
facility from 1947 until sometime before 1954. A series of name changes, mergers, incorporations, and
title conveyances have occurred since 1954. In 1981, Telford Industrial Development Authority purchased
the site from Milford Rivet and Machine Co., now known as Raymark Formed Products Co. The present
operator, Penn Fasteners, Inc., has manufactured rivets and fasteners at the site since 1980.
 
During 1948-72, treated wastes and untreated waste water from plating and degreasing operations were
disposed in four unlined lagoons on-site. In 1972, the accumulated sludge was removed and the lagoons
were filled in with clean fill and berm material. During the same period, trichloroethylene (TCE) was stored
in outdoor above-ground tanks. Penn Fasteners has contended that TCE is no longer used at the facility.
Building drains also are a suspected major source of existing soil contamination.
 
Since 1979, eight Hatboro Water Authority wells near the site have been contaminated with TCE. They
have been taken out of service or equipped with treatment systems. The Raymark Site has been identified
as a source of contamination of the Stockton Aquifer, which supplies drinking water to approximately
921,100 people via public and private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
In the most recent sampling (1986), EPA detected up to 3.1 million micrograms per kilogram of TCE in on-
site soil. Wells within 250 feet of the site are contaminated with TCE ranging from 14 to 8,600 micrograms
per liter. Up to 900 micrograms per liter of 1,2-dichloroethylene have been detected in monitoring wells in
the vicinity of the site.
 
The nearest surface water, Pennypack Creek, is approximately 6,800 feet downslope of the site. It is used
for recreational activities.
 
In 1985, the United States brought suit against present and past owners of the site -- including Raymark
Industries, Inc., Raymark Formed Products Co., and Penn Fasteners, Inc. -- under Section 7003 of the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Section 106 of CERCLA. A trial was held in 1987.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : In February 1989, EPA and the Hatboro Water Authority entered into a Consent
Decree with the Raymark defendants. The decree calls for them to provide $1.12 million to EPA and
Hatboro.
 
EPA is preparing plans for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. In conformance with the Consent
Decree, Hatboro is designing a system to pump ground water to the surface and treat it to remove
contaminants.
