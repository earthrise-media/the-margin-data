NPL Site Narrative for Woodbury Chemical
Co.
 
WOODBURY CHEMICAL CO.
Commerce City, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : Woodbury Chemical Co. operated a pesticide-formulating plant in
Commerce City, Colorado, from the late 1950s until 1965, when it was destroyed by fire. Fire debris and
rubble, including water-soaked bags of pesticides and contaminated soils, were disposed of in an adjacent
vacant lot. About 500 cubic yards of wastes are involved. Soil samples taken in the lot have high levels
of aldrin, DDT, endrin, and several other pesticides. The waste is uncovered, and the site unfenced and
unmarked. The potential exists for contamination of surface water and ground water, which may be as
shallow as 7 feet.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA will spend $65,000 to conduct a remedial investigation to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site, and a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action. The
work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 1984.
