NPL Site Narrative for Palmerton Zinc Pile
 
PALMERTON ZINC PILE
Palmerton, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Palmerton Zinc Pile occupies about 200 acres in Palmerton,
Pennsylvania, on the north slope of Blue Mountain along Aquashicola Creek. During the past 70 years,
New Jersey Zinc Co.'s nearby zinc smelter deposited 33 million tons of residue, creating a cinder bank that
extends for 2.5 miles and measures about 200 feet high and 500 to 1,000 feet wide. Zinc and cadmium
were detected in Aquashicola Creek and nearby drinking wells. Air pollution from the smelter has also
resulted in area-wide contamination, and very high concentrations of zinc and cadmium have been
detected in soil and garden vegetables.
 
Status (July 1983) : New Jersey Zinc Co. is controlling run-off from the cinder bank by placing material
containing large amounts of lime at the base of the bank, which precipitates the heavy metals. The
company has also graded and seeded the cinder bank to help reduce run-off.
