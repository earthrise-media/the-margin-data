NPL Site Narrative for Helen Kramer
Landfill
 
HELEN KRAMER LANDFILL
Mantua Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Helen Kramer Landfill covers 60 acres in Mantua Township,
Gloucester County, New Jersey. The privately owned landfill operated from 1970 until the State closed
it in 1980 because of permit violations. During this time the landfill received municipal waste, municipal
construction debris, and non-chemical industrial waste. Chlorinated organics and heavy metals have
been identified in ground water and surface water downgradient of the landfill. The ground water provides
drinking water, while the surface water downstream is used for irrigation. An underground fire at the site
in 1981 burned for about 2 months, emitting noxious fumes to surrounding areas. Airborne contaminants
were detected during and after the fire.
 
Status (July 1983) : In fall 1983, EPA plans to start a $350,000 remedial investigation to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site.
