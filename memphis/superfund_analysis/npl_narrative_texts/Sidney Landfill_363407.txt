NPL Site Narrative for Sidney Landfill
 
SIDNEY LANDFILL
Sidney, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Sidney Landfill covers 50 acres on the east side of Richardson
Hill Road approximately 1 mile from County Route 27 in the Town of Sidney, Delaware County, New York.
The area is sparsely populated and characterized by steep hills with farmlands and wooded areas.
 
During 1967-72, the privately owned operation accepted municipal and commercial refuse from the Town
of Sidney. New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) files indicate that waste
oils were also disposed of at the site.
 
Leachate seeps have been associated with the site since the late 1960s. According to a November 1983
NYSDEC report, the leachate had a high iron content, and a private well near the base of the landfill was
closed due to high iron content.
 
Five springs providing drinking water to six nearby homes were sampled by the New York Department
of Health in September 1985. The results indicated that three wells contained 1,1-dichloroethane,
trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethylene.
Seven monitoring wells installed by NYSDEC contained vinyl chloride, 1,1-dichloroethane, toluene,
trichloroethylene, trans-1,2-dichloroethane, and PCB-Aroclor 1242, according to tests conducted in 1986.
An estimated 1,700 people obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the site, the closest
0.02 mile downgradient.
 
Soils at the site are glacial till consisting of brown to grey clayey silt, some gravel, and a trace of sand. The
till thickness on-site varies from 7 to 37 feet. The ground water level is as shallow as 8 feet, with seasonal
fluctuations to 72 feet.
 
Analysis of leachate collected during the NYSDEC investigation in 1986 detected toluene, vinyl chloride,
trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, diethyl phthalate, acetone, ethylbenzene, phenol, and isophorone. Surface
water and sediment samples in two wetlands near the base of the landfill were contaminated with
trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene. Local surface waters are used for
recreational activities.
 
The site is not completely fenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact
with hazardous substances.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
