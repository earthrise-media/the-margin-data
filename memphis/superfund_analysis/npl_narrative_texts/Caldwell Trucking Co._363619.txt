NPL Site Narrative for Caldwell Trucking
Co.
 
CALDWELL TRUCKING CO.
Fairfield, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Caldwell Trucking Co. is an active sewage hauling firm
occupying 9 acres in Fairfield, Essex County, New Jersey. For several years up to 1974, the owners
hauled industrial waste and discharged it into four unlined lagoons. The sludge in the lagoons contains,
among other things, trichloroethylene, chloroform, and lead. About 50 private wells have been closed
because of contamination from this site, and another 50 to 100 are threatened. Two public wells have been
closed.
 
The plume of contaminated ground water is moving toward the Passaic River. The point where the plume
is predicted to enter the river is about 2 miles upstream of a drinking water intake in the river. In September
1982, the State required Caldwell Trucking to install monitoring wells and to decontaminate the site,
including removing contaminated soil and sludge from the lagoons.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at the site are currently being addressed through a State enforcement
action against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
