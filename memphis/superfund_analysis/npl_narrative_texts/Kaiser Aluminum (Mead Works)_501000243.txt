NPL Site Narrative for Kaiser Aluminum
(Mead Works)
 
KAISER ALUMINUM (MEAD WORKS)
Mead, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Kaiser Aluminum's Mead Works is located near the town of
Mead in Spokane County, Washington. Cyanide, originating from a 6-acre pile of spent pot liners on the
plant property, was first noticed in several drinking water wells in 1978. The cyanide has contaminated an
aquifer which is a tributary to the Little Spokane River. The company provided alternative water supplies to
27 homes with contaminated wells and paved the old pot-liner pile with impervious asphalt. Since 1980, the
pot liner wastes being generated have been placed in a specially constructed building.
 
Status (July 1983) : Kaiser continues to take corrective actions, including the elimination of a retention
pond. Water in the pond was infiltrating the contaminated soil beneath the storage pile and probably
carrying cyanide into the aquifer. Kaiser reports that the elimination of the pond has significantly reduced
the cyanide levels in certain test wells near the pile. Kaiser expects that improvements will continue and
that the aquifer will eventually be cleaned by normal inflow of uncontaminated ground water.
 
No additional remedial actions are scheduled. Kaiser will continue monitoring for an extended period to
determine if the cyanide is being contained effectively.
