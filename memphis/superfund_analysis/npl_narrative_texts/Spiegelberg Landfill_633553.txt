NPL Site Narrative for Spiegelberg Landfill
 
SPIEGELBERG LANDFILL
Green Oak Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Spiegelberg Landfill covers 10 acres in Green Oak
Township, Livingston County, Michigan. Prior to 1966, the site was an open dump. About 1977, unknown
quantities of paint sludges and liquid waste were dumped into a 0.5-acre pit from which sand and gravel
had been excavated. Later, the pit was covered with gravel. Disposal of paint sludges ceased, but
excavation of sand and gravel continues elsewhere on the site. All operations have been under private
ownership.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State completed a limited study to detect ground water contamination. EPA
recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full
extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
