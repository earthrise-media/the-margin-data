NPL Site Narrative for Kellogg-Deering
Well Field
 
KELLOGG-DEERING WELL FIELD
Norwalk, Connecticut
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Kellogg-Deering Well Field covers 10 acres in Norwalk,
Fairfield County, Connecticut. It contains four wells that supply Norwalk's 45,000 residents. In 1975,
routine monitoring by the Norwalk First Taxing District Water Department detected elevated levels
of trichloroethylene in the wells. Since then, the State and private parties have investigated the site
extensively to define the problem and identify source(s) of contamination. The water department blends
water from the wells and nearby reservoirs to provide water that is safe for human consumption.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is working with the water department to clean up the site. EPA has obligated
$475,000 for remedial planning activities and for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
