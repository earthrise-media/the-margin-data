NPL Site Narrative for Cleve Reber
 
CLEVE REBER
Sorrento, Louisiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Cleve Reber site covers 25 acres near Sorrento, Louisiana,
in Ascension Parish, about 25 miles southeast of Baton Rouge. Wastes were dumped at the site in the
early 1970s until it was abandoned in 1972. From 500 to 600 barrels are visible on the surface. Some are
corroding, and others appear to have exploded. They contain sulfur, asphalt, tars, plastics, and oily wastes.
Also on the site are four ponds of water, piles of dry chemical waste, and an estimated 2,500 drums buried
at shallow depths.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1983, EPA approved $200,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to remove
surface drums, contaminated soil, and dry chemical wastes.
 
The State and EPA are planning to undertake a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
