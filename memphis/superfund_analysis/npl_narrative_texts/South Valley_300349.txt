Albuquerque, New Mexico
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The South Valley Site covers about 2 square miles south of
Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1979, wells in the San Jose well field became contaminated by organic
compounds, forcing closing of one private well and two Albuquerque municipal wells. Numerous sources
are suspected of contributing to the problem.
 
This is the top priority site in New Mexico.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State, with a grant of $80,200 made available through the Clean Water Act, is
attempting to determine the extent of ground water pollution and possible specific sources of contaminants.
In addition, EPA is evaluating methods of restoring the capacity of the Albuquerque wells lost due to
contamination.
 
EPA is starting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
