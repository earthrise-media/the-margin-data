NPL Site Narrative for Upper Deerfield
Township Sanitary Landfill
 
UPPER DEERFIELD TOWNSHIP SANITARY LANDFILL
Upper Deerfield Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Upper Deerfield Township Sanitary Landfill is an active 14-
acre sanitary landfill operated by Upper Deerfield Township in a rural area of Cumberland County, New
Jersey. On-site monitoring wells and five private wells are contaminated with mercury and chlorinated
solvents, according to analyses conducted by the State. The wells tap the Cohansey Aquifer, the major
source of drinking water for the area. The contamination is traveling south toward other residential wells.
There are no substantiated reports of hazardous material being disposed of at the landfill, so the amount
and sources remain unknown. Further contamination of the aquifer is of concern.
 
The State and local health department advised affected residents not to drink their water and are
monitoring other homes in the immediate area for signs of contamination.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State is negotiating with the township for cleanup of the site.
