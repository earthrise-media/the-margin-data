LEMBERGER TRANSPORT & RECYCLING, INC.
Franklin Township, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : From 1969 to 1976, Lemberger Transport & Recycling, Inc.,
operated an unlined landfill in Franklin Township, Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. From 800,000 to 1 million
gallons of tars and paint sludges were buried at the site. Heavy metals (mainly cadmium and lead) and
phenols have leached into ground water, according to analyses conducted by the State. Large quantities
of aluminum dust are also buried nearby. Ground water connected to the site supplies water for more than
900 people within 3 miles of the site.
 
The owner of the site farms property adjoining the site and has plowed portions of the site, exposing bulk
wastes and drums.
 
In 1982, the State signed a Consent Order with the company requiring a report on site conditions, extent of
ground water contamination, and preliminary remedial actions.
 
Status (June 1984) : The company has not fully complied with the Consent Order, so the State has
referred the matter to the State Attorney General's Office for action.
 
EPA is conducting a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
