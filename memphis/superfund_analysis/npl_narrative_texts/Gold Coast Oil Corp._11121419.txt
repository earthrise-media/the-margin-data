GOLD COAST OIL CORP.
Miami, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Gold Coast Oil Corp. reclaimed solvents on a 2-acre site
in Miami, Florida, leased from Seaboard Coast Line Railroad Co. On the site are 2,500 corroded and
leaking drums containing sludge from the solvent distilling operation, contaminated soils, and paint wastes.
Additionally, large storage tanks of hazardous waste are located on-site. EPA detected lead, zinc, and
various organic pollutants in shallow ground water at the site, part of the Biscayne Aquifer, which is the
principal source of drinking water in this part of Florida.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State evicted Gold Coast Oil from the property in 1982, and Seaboard Coast Line
voluntarily cleaned up the site in August 1982, with EPA personnel monitoring the activities. Also, EPA (1)
recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full
extent of cleanup required at the site and (2) is conducting a search for all potential generators of wastes at
the site.
