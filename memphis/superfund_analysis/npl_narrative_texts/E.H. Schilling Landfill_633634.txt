NPL Site Narrative for E.H. Schilling
Landfill
 
E.H. SCHILLING LANDFILL
Hamilton Township, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : E.H. Schilling Landfill covers 5 acres in Hamilton Township,
4.5 miles downriver from Ironton, Ohio. The site, which was privately owned and operated, was licensed
by the State to receive industrial waste. It operated from April 1972 until July 1980, when its license was
revoked because it accepted liquid waste and failed to cover waste properly with soil. While the landfill was
operating, hazardous substances entered surface water. After the landfill closed, the site was covered.
Leachate is still migrating from the landfill, although the owner has attempted to contain the flow.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
