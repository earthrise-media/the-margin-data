NPL Site Narrative for Lemon Lane
Landfill
 
LEMON LANE LANDFILL
Bloomington, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Lemon Lane Landfill is located on the western edge of
Bloomington, Indiana. The site is 10.7 acres, of which 3 acres are owned by a private citizen. From 1950
to 1964, the site, which has no liner or run-off controls, accepted both municipal and industrial wastes.
Allegedly, wastes were incinerated on-site. No records were kept of the types or quantities of wastes
received. Of primary concern are large quantities of exposed capacitors containing PCBs. Many are
leaking and have contaminated underlying soils, which are thin and irregular. PCBs in the soil range
from 0.1 to 330,000 parts per million. Starting in 1980, the State and EPA sampled several times in the
area. They detected no PCBs in nearby residential wells at the time, nor did they observe any surface
discharges. However, the geology of the area suggests that ground water contamination is possible.
Pedestrians have easy access to the site, and children use it as a play area.
 
Status (July 1983) : Using CERCLA emergency funds, Bloomington is working with EPA to erect a security
fence around the site.
