NPL Site Narrative for Torch Lake
 
TORCH LAKE
Houghton County, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Torch Lake is in Houghton County in the upper peninsula of
Michigan. Copper mining companies dumped tailings into the 2,660-acre lake from the 1890s to as recently
as 1969. About 20 percent of the original lake volume has been filled with wastes, contaminating the lake
sediments with copper. In 1972, cupric ammonium carbonate spilled into the lake from storage vats.
 
Cancerous growth has been documented in two fish species. The public health department has issued a
health advisory on fish consumption.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : This mining site is being placed on the NPL at this time because the State of
Michigan does not have an approved program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of
1977 (SMCRA) and so is not eligible for SMCRA reclamation funds.
