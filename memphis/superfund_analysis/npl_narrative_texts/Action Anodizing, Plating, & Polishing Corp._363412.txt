NPL Site Narrative for Action Anodizing,
Plating, & Polishing Corp.
 
ACTION ANODIZING, PLATING, & POLISHING CORP.
Copiague, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Action Anodizing, Plating, & Polishing Corp. (AAPP) has
operated on a 1-acre site at 33 Dixon Avenue in Copiague, New York, since 1986. The site is in
southwestern Suffolk County approximately 1.1 miles east of the Nassau/Suffolk County line. Amityville
Creek, a small tributary to Great South Bay, is 0.5 mile southeast of the site. The upper reach of the creek
is designated as a fresh water wetland.
 
AAPP's anodizing process includes cleaning, sealing, and, at times, dyeing aluminum parts. In addition,
operations include cadmium plating. Prior to 1982, waste water containing high concentrations of heavy
metals, including cadmium, chromium, and lead, was discharged to underground leaching pools. In
response to actions by the Suffolk County Department of Health Services (SCDHS), AAPP cleaned up and
closed the leaching pool system. This work was supervised and approved by SCDHS.
 
Soils on the site are permeable and ground water is shallow (approximately 10 feet). These conditions
facilitate movement of contaminants into ground water, which is the sole source of drinking water in the
area. At least one public well field is within 1 mile of the site. An estimated 1 million residents of Suffolk and
Nassau Counties obtain drinking water from public wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
