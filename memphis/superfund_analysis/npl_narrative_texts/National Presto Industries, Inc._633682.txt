NPL Site Narrative for National Presto
Industries, Inc.
 
NATIONAL PRESTO INDUSTRIES, INC.
Eau Claire, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : National Presto Industries, Inc., has manufactured artillery
projectiles in Eau Claire, Chippewa County, Wisconsin, since 1955. The plant operates on a standby status
for the Department of Defense.
 
The company has a waste water permit from the State for two ponds (1.9 acres and 14 acres) and two
seepage lagoons (each 3 acres) on its property. Process wastes flowed through the ponds, where metal
particles and oils were removed, to the seepage lagoons, where the waste water was discharged to
ground water. The sludge remaining in the ponds is contaminated with heavy metals and traces of volatile
organic compounds, according to tests conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The
presence of the sludge and its improper treatment violate the State waste water permit.
 
The toxic nature of the sludge and hydrogeologic studies conducted by the State indicate a potential threat
to the Eau Claire Well Field, which serves 57,500 people.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
