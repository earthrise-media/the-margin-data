NPL Site Narrative for Old Springfield
Landfill
 
OLD SPRINGFIELD LANDFILL
Springfield, Vermont
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Old Springfield Landfill, in Springfield, Vermont, is on a
terrace above and 0.3 mile west of the Black River. On the 80-acre site now are a trailer park and a few
homes. From 1946 to 1968, the privately-owned site was the principal disposal place for Springfield's
domestic and industrial wastes, including waste oils, solvents, paint sludges, plating and etching wastes,
and strong acids. Leachate flows to the Black River and Seaver Brook. Neither is used as a drinking water
source. Of 10 private drinking wells tested in the immediate area, one had low levels of volatile organics
and two had metals. Metal contamination in two private wells has been determined to cause no immediate
health risk, but has rendered the water aesthetically undrinkable. Alternative water supplies have been
suggested for the one residence with a well contaminated by organics.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is monitoring the residential wells in the area on a quarterly basis.
 
EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine
the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
