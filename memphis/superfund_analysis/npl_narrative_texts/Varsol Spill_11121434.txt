NPL Site Narrative for Varsol Spill
 
VARSOL SPILL
Miami, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 23, 1981) : An underground pipeline leak resulted in the discharge of
about 1.6 million gallons of Varsol (a petroleum solvent) at the Miami, Florida, International Airport. After
the spill was discovered in 1968, underground concrete walls were installed. The walls, along with an
existing storm drain, contain the solvent, which floats on top of the Biscayne Aquifer, within the airport.
About 2,000 feet from the walls is the Miami Springs Well Field, which provides some of Miami's drinking
water. At the time of the spill, Dade County took an enforcement action against Eastern Airlines, owner of
the material.
 
To emphasize the threat to the regional water supply, this site, the Miami Drum Services Site, and
Northwest 58th Street Landfill were collectively designated as the "Biscayne Aquifer Site" when they were
first listed.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : EPA recently completed a remedial investigation at this site as part of the
area-wide "Biscayne Aquifer" project. In January 1983, EPA approved $200,000 for a feasibility study of
the aquifer. The work is scheduled to be completed shortly.
 
Status (September 1, 1988) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Florida, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
