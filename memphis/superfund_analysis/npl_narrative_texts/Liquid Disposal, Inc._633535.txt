NPL Site Narrative for Liquid Disposal,
Inc.
 
LIQUID DISPOSAL, INC.
Utica, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Liquid Disposal, Inc., (LDI) Site covers 6 acres in Utica, Macomb
County, Michigan. The site contains an incinerator for liquid wastes, various industrial liquids and sludges
in two lagoons, numerous surface and buried tanks, over 1,000 drums, and numerous small containers.
Following an incident in which hydrogen sulfide gas was produced and killed two workers, the citizens of
Shelby Township filed suit in January 1982 to permanently enjoin LDI from operating. In April 1982, LDI
was forced into involuntary bankruptcy and closed permanently in May 1982. EPA and State investigations
have revealed contamination of air, soil, surface water, and ground water in the vicinity of the site. In May
1982 EPA cleaned up a PCB-contaminated oil spill at the site. In July 1982, EPA removed liquid wastes
from a lagoon that was in danger of overflowing and contaminated water from the area surrounding the
incinerator. A total of $319,000 was expended on these cleanups.
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1983, EPA awarded a $346,732 Cooperative Agreement to Michigan for a
remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action. In May 1983, $580,000 was approved for a third emergency action
involving disposing of wastes in two lagoons, overpacking leaking drums, and removing miscellaneous
wastes from the site. The action is scheduled for completion in summer 1983.
