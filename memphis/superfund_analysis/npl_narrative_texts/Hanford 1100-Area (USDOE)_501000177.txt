NPL Site Narrative for Hanford 1100-Area
(USDOE)
 
HANFORD 1100-AREA (USDOE)
Benton County, Washington
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Hanford 1100-Area is approximately 1 mile north of the
City of Richland, Benton County, Washington, in the southeast section of the 570-square-mile Hanford
Site. Since 1943, Hanford has been the scene of Federal nuclear activities, primarily production of nuclear
materials for national defense.
 
The U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) conducts maintenance operations in the 1100-Area. The
area covers less than 1 acre and contains a sand pit, an underground tank, and other areas of potential
contamination. An estimated 15,000 gallons of waste battery acid were disposed of in the pit; the tank,
which was used to store waste antifreeze, was suspected of leaking.
 
Ground water occurs at 24 feet, with highly permeable sand and gravel overlying the aquifer; these
conditions facilitate movement of contaminants into ground water. To date, USDOE has not detected any
contaminants in ground water in the 1100-Area. Richland has wells within 3 miles of the 1100-Area that
draw drinking water from the shallow aquifer. The nearest well is 2,640 feet from the disposal area. Almost
70,000 people obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the 1100-Area.
 
EPA, USDOE, and the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) are jointly developing an action plan
that will include the work needed to address this area under the Superfund program, as well as other work
needed to meet permitting, corrective action, and compliance requirements of Subtitle C of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : On May 15, 1989, EPA, USDOE, and WDOE signed a comprehensive
agreement for the cleanup of the entire Hanford Site, including the area covered in this NPL site. This
Federal Facility Agreement and State Consent Order contains schedules for remedial investigations and
feasibility studies for Superfund work at the Hanford Site.
