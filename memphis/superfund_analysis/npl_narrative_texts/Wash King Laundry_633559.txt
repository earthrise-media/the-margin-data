NPL Site Narrative for Michigan Disposal
Service (Cork Street Landfill)
 
MICHIGAN DISPOSAL SERVICE (CORK STREET LANDFILL)
Pleasant Plains Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Wash King Laundry, a small privately owned laundromat, has
been in operation in Pleasant Plains Township, Lake County, Michigan, since 1962. During the early
1970s, dry cleaning solvents were discharged with laundry wastes to the facility's waste water lagoons.
As a result, about 30 residential water supplies to the north were contaminated with perchloroethylene
(PCE). PCE contamination was first detected in August 1977 in a well used by a local business. In 1978,
the State cleaned out the laundromat's lagoons and forced the firm to stop using PCE. A preliminary
study conducted in 1979 by the State established that Wash King Laundry was responsible for the PCE
contamination. A contaminated plume of ground water is migrating to the northeast toward the Middle
Branch of the Pere Marquette River.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
