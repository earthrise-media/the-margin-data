NPL Site Narrative for Diamond Shamrock
Corp. Landfill
 
DIAMOND SHAMROCK CORP. LANDFILL
Cedartown, Georgia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : The Diamond Shamrock Corp. Landfill covers less than 1
acre in Cedartown, Polk County, Georgia. Between 1972 and 1977 the company buried drummed and bulk
waste in three 6-foot-deep trenches. The waste included fungicides, amides, oil and oil sludges, esters,
ethers, alcohols, and metallic salts, according to the company. In 1986, the site was sold to Occidental
Chemical Corp.
 
The trenches are unlined, in an area of permeable soils, and in the floodplain of Cedar Creek, which is a
major tributary of the Coosa River. Ground water is shallow (less than 10 feet). These conditions potentially
threaten surface water and ground water in the area.
 
An estimated 25,000 people draw drinking water from public wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
