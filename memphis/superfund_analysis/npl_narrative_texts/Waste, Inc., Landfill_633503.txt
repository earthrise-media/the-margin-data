NPL Site Narrative for Waste, Inc., Landfill
 
WASTE, INC., LANDFILL
Michigan City, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : The Waste, Inc., Landfill covers 10 acres in a wetland within the
limits of Michigan City, La Porte County, Indiana. The area is industrial with an urban population of about
34,000.
 
During 1966-82, the landfill accepted approximately 128,000 tons of industrial waste contaminated with
PCBs, heavy metals, and organic solvents. It was not permitted to accept such wastes. The landfill was
unlined, and there were no dikes to control run-off. Originally, the site sloped down to the creek. Now, the
landfill rises 50 feet above surrounding terrain.
 
In December 1983, EPA detected heptachlor in one well on the site. Ground water below the site is
shallow. About 2,100 people depend on private wells within 3 miles of the site for their drinking water.
 
The site drains into nearby Trail Creek, which discharges to Lake Michigan. EPA has detected 3 parts per
million each of arsenic and PCBs in the creek. These levels exceed EPA drinking water standards. People
are known to fish in the creek.
 
In May 1981, the State and Dis-Pos-All Service, Inc. (a previous owner/operator of the site) signed an
Agreed Order limiting acceptance of refuse from Josam Foundry and McLain Foundry. In January 1982, in
response to a State court order, the landfill stopped operations.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : Under a Consent Order with EPA, signed on March 31, 1987, nine potentially
responsible parties agreed to undertake a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
