NPL Site Narrative for Kent City Mobile
Home Park
 
KENT CITY MOBILE HOME PARK
Kent City, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Kent City Mobile Home Park is comprised of about
75 homes in Kent City, Kent County, Michigan. Ground water at the park is contaminated with organic
solvents (chloroform, toluene, methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, and carbon tetrachloride), according to
tests conducted by EPA. To date, no contamination has been detected in off-site wells. The contamination
may be the result of solvents buried by a former on-site dry cleaner.
 
The State detected benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene in an oily substance seeping south into
Ball Creek. The creek runs through the 2 acres of known ground water contamination. The 2,800 people in
the mobile home park and surrounding area now use water from two new wells drilled in 1983-84 by Kent
City Mobile Home Park.
 
In April 1984, a 55-gallon drum was removed from the site under State supervision.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
