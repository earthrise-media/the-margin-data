NPL Site Narrative for AMCO Chemical
 
AMCO CHEMICAL
Oakland, California
 
 
Conditions at Proposal (April 30, 2003) : The AMCO Chemical site (AMCO) is part of a 0.83-acre
property at 1414 Third Street in a mixed residential and light industrial area of Oakland, California. The
property is bordered on the north by a vacant lot, on the west by residences, on the east by Nelson
Mandela Parkway, and on the south by Third Street. A recently constructed elevated portion of the
Interstate-880 (I-880) freeway is located immediately across Third Street from the property. The property
(at 1401 Third Street) was historically occupied by Bobo's Junkyard.
 
From the 1960s to 1989, the AMCO site was occupied by AMCO Chemical Company. AMCO operated a
chemical distribution facility that included a warehouse, railroad spur, above-ground tanks, underground
tanks, and drums used to transfer and store raw materials. In July 1988, the Oakland Fire Department
observed "leaking/rotting drums" on the property. A subsequent emergency response investigation by
Alameda County and the U.S. Coast Guard revealed greater than 100 full and empty 5- and 55-gallon
weathered drums in an open area behind AMCO Chemical's main building. Stenciled labels on the drums
indicated that the contents included acetone; 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA); methyl ethyl ketone; and
dry-cleaning solvent. From 1989 to November 1998, DC Metals operated a scrap metal yard on the site.
Cable Moore, Inc., currently uses the site for cable storage. Structures remaining on site include an office
building, warehouse, and two small storage buildings.
 
In June 1995, a construction crew noted odors at the intersection of Third Street and Nelson Mandela
Parkway, while excavating a trench needed to relocate an underground electrical line in preparation
for a freeway project. Subsequent subsurface investigation by California Department of Transportation
(Caltrans), DC Metals, and EPA revealed the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including
vinyl chloride in soil, soil gas, and shallow ground water at the AMCO site, beneath Third Street, and at the
1401 Third Street property (former Bobo's Junkyard).
 
On December 5, 1996, the EPA Emergency Response Office initiated a removal action at the AMCO site
that involved the construction of a ground water and soil vapor extraction (SVE) treatment system. The
EPA treatment system collection trench was excavated from December 5 through December 20, 1996. By
December 23, 1996, the trench had been lined with a silt curtain, filled with gravel, and covered with a tarp.
Cement was poured to permanently cover the trench on January 8, 1997. The treatment system operated
from January 1997 through July 1998 and extracted approximately 7,000 pounds of VOCs, approximately
40 pounds of which were vinyl chloride. Operation of the system ceased in July 1998, due to community
concern over the potential for a release of dioxins from the thermal oxidation unit. On December 5 and
14, 1996, during construction of the treatment system collection trench, the EPA On-Scene Coordinator
observed shimmering vapors emanating from the open trench. SUMMA (tm) canister sampling indicated
the presence of vinyl chloride; methylene chloride; 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA); and trichloroethene (TCE)
in the immediate area of the trench. In addition, one SUMMA canister sample collected from in front of a
residence adjacent to the site contained TCE.
 
The EPA conducted several sampling events on and adjacent to the AMCO site between 1997 and 2000.
VOCs continued to be detected in soil, soil gas, and ground water on site. In September 1999, SUMMA
canister samples were collected from the crawl spaces of three residences located adjacent to the site.
Vinyl chloride was detected in the three crawl spaces at 0.02 to 0.045 parts per billion by volume (ppbv).
 
There are 626 people living within a quarter of a mile of the source. There are also approximately three
workers on site.
 
Status (September 2003) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
