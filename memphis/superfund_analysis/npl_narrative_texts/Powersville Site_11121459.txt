NPL Site Narrative for Powersville Site
 
POWERSVILLE SITE
Peach County, Georgia
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Peach County Sanitary Landfill, commonly referred to
as the "Powersville Site," covers 15 acres in Peach County, Georgia. It accepted hazardous waste from
Woolfolk Chemical Co. from the early 1960s until 1983. Records indicate that wastes containing various
pesticides have been disposed of at the site. The site itself is now separated into two portions: a hazardous
waste area, which is fenced and posted, and a larger municipal waste landfill. However, the State suspects
that hazardous wastes have been buried in both sections.
 
In April 1983, the State analyzed samples collected from a nearby church well and detected lindane,
benzene hexachloride (BHC), and dieldrin. The State requested the church to discontinue use of the well.
 
The Powersville Site is located in the recharge zone of the Cretaceous Aquifer, the Providence Sand (a
major aquifer for local water supplies), and the Gosport Sand. Furthermore, the sandy surface soils permit
practically all of the 5 inches of net annual precipitation in the area to go directly into the ground. About 15
private water wells are within 0.3 mile of the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA completed a topographic, geologic, and geophysical study of the site in
November 1983. In April 1984, EPA completed installation of a network of monitoring wells. Samples were
collected from these wells as well as many private wells. Results are pending.
