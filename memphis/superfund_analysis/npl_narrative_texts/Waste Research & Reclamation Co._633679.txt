NPL Site Narrative for Waste Research &
Reclamation Co.
 
WASTE RESEARCH & RECLAMATION CO.
Eau Claire, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Waste Research & Reclamation Co. has recycled oil and
solvents from industrial sources at a 19-acre site in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, since 1975. Hazardous wastes
were also treated and stored on the site, which is privately owned and operated. It is located about 0.5
mile east of Lowes Creek, a tributary of the Chippewa River. The techniques used to handle and store
drums allowed wastes to spill on the site. Run-off from waste processing has been collected in unlined
impoundments. Organic solvents from the site contaminate ground water, according to analyses conducted
by the State, but to date no residential wells are contaminated.
 
In June 1980, the State ordered the company to monitor the ground water. The company submitted a
technical response, which the State evaluated.
 
Status (June 1984) : In February 1983, the State signed a Consent Order with the company for a long-term
monitoring program. The results of the technical investigation are due later this year.
