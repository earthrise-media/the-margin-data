LORING AIR FORCE BASE
Limestone, Maine
 
 
Conditions at proposal (July 14, 1989) : Loring Air Force Base covers nearly 9,000 acres in Aroostock
County in a sparsely populated area of northeastern Maine. Limestone is 2 miles to the east, Caribou 8
miles to the west, and the New Brunswick, Canada, border 3 miles to the east. Loring has been active
since 1952 and has been home to the Strategic Air Command's 42nd Bombardment Wing since 1953.
Hazardous wastes generated on-base include waste oils, fuels cleaned from aircraft and vehicles, spent
solvents (many of them chlorinated organic chemicals), PCBs, and pesticides. Historically, wastes have
been burned or buried in landfills.
 
Loring Air Force Base is participating in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), established in 1978.
Under this program, the Department of Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination
from hazardous materials. IRP tests reported in 1986 indicate that monitoring wells on the base are
contaminated with methylene chloride, trichloroethylene (TCE), carbon tetrachloride, and barium. The wells
are on or downgradient of several widely scattered disposal areas. Two are adjacent landfills, both old
gravel pits, covering 190 acres. Landfill 2 was used for disposal of hazardous wastes during 1956-74, and
Landfill 3 from 1974 to the early 1980s. In the 0.5-acre Fire Department Training Area, large quantities of
hazardous materials were landfilled until 1968 and burned until 1974. The 600-acre Flightline Area, with
its industrial shops and maintenance hangars, was a primary generator of hazardous waste on-base; most
wastes were disposed of elsewhere, although some probably were disposed of on the ground or concrete
or in the storm and sewer drains.
 
Soils in the Flightline Area also contain significant amounts of fuel, oil, and various volatile organic
chemicals. An estimated 1,200 people obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of hazardous
substances on the base; the nearest well is less than 500 feet from where transformers were buried.
 
Water in the Flightline Drainage Ditch (a 2,500-foot channelized portion of a tributary to Greenlaw Creek)
is contaminated with methylene chloride, tetrachloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, TCE, and iron,
according to the 1986 IRP report. The ditch receives storm water discharges from several sewers draining
the Flightline Area and the Nose Dock Area, where fuels were handled. Surface water within 3 miles
downstream is used for recreational activities. A fresh water wetland is 500 feet from Landfill 3.
 
The 8,500 people on the base can come in direct contact with hazardous substances at the landfills and
burn pit because they are inadequately fenced.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : EPA is reviewing information on the base in preparation for negotiations in
1990 with the Air Force for an Interagency Agreement under CERCLA Section 120 covering further studies
and remedial activities.
