NPL Site Narrative for Joseph Forest

JOSEPH FOREST PRODUCTS
Joseph, Oregon
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Joseph Forest Products formerly treated wood on an 18.5-acre
site approximately 0.8 mile northwest of the Town of Joseph, Wallowa County, Oregon.
 
The wood treatment process used a water-based mixture of chromated copper arsenate. Wastes were
stored in a cement pit and sump prior to removal. A fire in 1974 resulted in a spill of concentrated
preservative mixture to the ground. In 1986, EPA detected high levels of arsenic and chromium and lower
levels of copper in on-site soils.
 
The shallow aquifer occurs at 5 to 10 feet below the surface and is overlain by very permeable soils,
conditions that facilitate movement of contaminants into ground water.
 
Ground water within 3 miles of the site provides drinking water to over 2,000 people. The City of Enterprise
gets its drinking water from springs 4,000 feet from the site. Ground water is also used for irrigation. The
site lies within the City of Enterprise Watershed Protection Area.
 
The Wallowa River is 400 feet east of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality is sampling several
monitoring wells and springs around the site on a quarterly basis.
