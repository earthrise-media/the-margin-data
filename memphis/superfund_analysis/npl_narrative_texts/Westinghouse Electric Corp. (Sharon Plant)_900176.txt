NPL Site Narrative for Westinghouse
Electric Corp. (Sharon Plant)
 
WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CORP. (SHARON PLANT)
Sharon, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Westinghouse Electric Corp. produced and repaired
transformers during 1922-84 on a 50-acre site at 409 Sharpsville Avenue in a heavily industrialized area
of Sharon, Mercer County, Pennsylvania. During 1936-76, Westinghouse used PCBs as a conducting
fluid in some of the transformers. In 1976, 48,000 gallons of PCBs and 15,000 gallons of organic
solvents were removed from the site and incinerated. PCBs were spilled in certain areas during routine
operations. In 1984, at least 6,000 gallons of solvents and oil leaked from an underground tank and
became contaminated with PCBs in the soil.
 
In November 1985, EPA detected PCB 1260 at two of the four points where the plant discharges waste
water to the Shenango River, which is 0.5 mile to the east. The company had a permit for the discharges
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). The Shenango Valley Water
Co. provides drinking water to an estimated 75,000 people from an intake approximately 1,600 feet
downstream of the plant's discharge points. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
(PA DER) detected PCBs in river sediments between the site and the intake.
 
Tests conducted in 1986 by a Westinghouse consultant detected PCBs, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and
methyl ethyl ketone in on-site ground water.
 
In April 1985, PA DER issued Westinghouse an Administrative Order under the State's Clean Streams
Law and Solid Waste Management Act. Under the order, Westinghouse has conducted a limited study of
subsurface conditions and submitted a cleanup plan to PA DER.
 
This facility obtained Interim Status under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) when it filed a Notification of Hazardous Waste Activity and Part A of a permit application to treat,
store, or dispose of hazardous waste. Later, it withdrew its Part A and converted to generator-only status
with EPA or State approval. Hence, it satisfies a component of EPA's NPL/RCRA policy.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : On September 21, 1988, Westinghouse and PA DER signed a Consent Order
and Agreement under which Westinghouse is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
Field work started in March 1990.
