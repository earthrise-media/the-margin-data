NPL Site Narrative for Mid-Atlantic Wood
Preservers, Inc.
 
MID-ATLANTIC WOOD PRESERVERS, INC.
Harmans, Maryland
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Mid-Atlantic Wood Preservers, Inc., treats wood on a 3-
acre site in Harmans, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. The plant, owned by Fort McHenry Lumber Co.,
produces lumber which is pressure treated with chromated copper arsenate to protect against water and
insect damage.
 
In 1978, the State detected chromium and arsenic in on-site soil and ground water. The contamination
appears to have resulted from tank overflows and drippings from storage of treated wood. In November
1980, on order of the State, the company removed 26 cubic yards of contaminated soil and transported it
to a regulated facility for disposal. The State also found that surface water draining from the site to Stony
Run was contaminated with elevated levels of copper. About 75,000 people depend on wells within 3 miles
of the site for drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In March 1985, EPA completed a search for parties potentially responsible for
wastes associated with the site. In April 1985, EPA issued notice letters to the parties for their comment
and review. EPA is investigating the possibility of the parties undertaking a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action.
