NPL Site Narrative for Lehillier/Mankato
Site
 
LEHILLIER/MANKATO SITE
Lehillier, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Le Hillier/Mankato Site covers 6,400 acres in Le Hillier, just
west of Mankato, Minnesota. In October 1981, the State discovered chlorinated organic solvents in the
community's ground water. The contamination may come from degreasers used in cleaning local septic
tanks.
 
Le Hillier is located in a floodplain of the Blue Earth and Minnesota River. Until 1976, when the U.S. Corps
of Engineers constructed a dike around this area, it was subject to seasonal flooding. The contaminated
area of Le Hillier/Mankato has permeable soils that allow liquids to infiltrate rapidly into the aquifer, thought
to be 20 to 25 feet below the surface; bedrock (sandstone) is at about 60 feet.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA and the State are conducting a preliminary hydrogeological study of this area to
determine the source(s) of contamination and the extent of the contaminated plume of ground water.
