NPL Site Narrative for Cannon
Engineering Corp. (CEC)
 
CANNON ENGINEERING CORP. (CEC)
Bridgewater, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Cannon Engineering Corp. (CEC) Site occupies 3 acres in
Bridgewater, Massachusetts. From 1974 to 1980, CEC was licensed to transport, store, and incinerate
certain types of hazardous wastes. On-site structures include 21 storage tanks, three buildings, an office/
warehouse, and an incinerator. Ground water south of the site is contaminated with benzene, 1,1,1-
trichloroethane, and toluene. To date, no contamination of drinking water wells has been detected. A pond
to the south and a swamp to the west are also contaminated. Owners of CEC were indicted for illegal
storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. The company is in receivership, but the receiver is not able
to finance the continued operation of the facility. In October 1982, the State contracted for removal and
disposal of hazardous wastes in tanks (about 150,000 gallons) and in about 600 drums. The cleanup was
completed in December 1982.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. EPA is planning a remedial investigation
to determine the type and extent of contamination of soils, ground water, and surface water, both on- and
off-site.
