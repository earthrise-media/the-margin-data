SOLVENTS RECOVERY SERVICE OF NEW ENGLAND
Southington, Connecticut
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Solvents Recovery Service of New England (SRSNE) began
to distill and recover solvents in Southington, Connecticut, in 1955. Wastes were stored and disposed of
on-site until the mid-1970s on 12 acres west of the Quinnipiac River. In 1965, the Town of Southington
installed Production Well #4 about 2,000 feet south of SRSNE, south of the Quinnipiac River. In 1976,
Southington Production Well #6 was installed about 1,300 feet south of SRSNE, on the north side of
the Quinnipiac. In September 1976, the State found that both wells were contaminated with volatile
organic compounds. In February 1980, an EPA contractor confirmed that SRSNE was responsible for the
contamination of Production Well #6 and discovered that other closer sources south of the Quinnipiac were
contributing to the contamination of Production Well #4.
 
Status (July 1983) : In December 1982, SRSNE signed a Consent Decree with EPA requiring (1) a system
to recover ground water on- and off-site and (2) a plan for on-site storage and management of hazardous
wastes. In June 1983, the company submitted a complete engineering analysis for the design of the on-site
system to EPA.
