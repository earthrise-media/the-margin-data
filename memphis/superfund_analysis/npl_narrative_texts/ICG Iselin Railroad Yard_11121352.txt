NPL Site Narrative for ICG Iselin Railroad
Yard
 
ICG ISELIN RAILROAD YARD
Jackson, Tennessee
 
 
Conditions at Proposal (May 10, 1993) : The ICG Iselin Railroad Yard (ICG Iselin) is located in Jackson,
Madison County, Tennessee. The 80-acre site is situated at the intersection of Eastern Street and
Magnolia Street in a predominately suburban area.
 
From 1906 to 1940, the property was owned and operated by Mobile & Ohio Railroad Co. (M&O).
According to a 1926 tax map for the City, the facility at one time included a round house, a steam
locomotive fueling station, a coal-fired power plant, and the locomotive maintenance building. In 1940,
M&O was sold to Gulf Mobile & Ohio Railroad Co., which reorganized in 1972 as the Illinois Central Gulf
Railroad Co. (ICG). From 1972 to 1986 ICG used the site as a locomotive maintenance facility. The
Williams Steel Co. purchased partial acreage in 1986, and used it as a steel fabrication facility until 1989.
In that year, the property was transferred to its present owner Iselin Properties, Inc. through Campbell &
Associates. The remaining acreage is owned by Norfolk Southern Railway Co. The ICG Iselin site includes
a main warehouse; numerous railroad tracks; storage tanks; a pollution abatement system that includes
a lye vat, a neutralization tank, several drainage ditches, a concrete tank, and a surface impoundment; a
battery waste disposal pile; and a fueling platform under an open-air shed.
 
Disposal practices at the site prior to 1972 are unknown. In 1973, ICG Iselin was issued a temporary
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for discharge into river mile 0.5 of Jones
Creek, pending the construction and approval of a pollution abatement facility. In 1975 and in 1980, the
facility reported that it exceeded its NPDES permit parameters for chromium.
 
A 1990 investigation by the Tennessee Department of Health and Environment identified organic and
inorganic constituents in surface soils. In 1991, the EPA conducted further sampling. Both investigations
showed elevated levels of chromium, copper, and lead in surface soils. The 1991 investigation also
identified vinyl chloride, chloroethane, tetrachloroethene, 1,1-dichloroethane, benzene, ethylbenzene, and
xylenes in on-site sediments.
 
The Jackson Utility Division supplies drinking water to approximately 31,000 people from 10 wells within 4
miles of the facility.
 
Status (December 1994) : The State of Tennessee has taken the role of lead agency for Remedial
Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS) activities. On June 6, 1994, the State issued a Commissioner's
Order requiring the PRPs to perform a RI/FS for the site. The Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) are
currently performing the RI/FS under State oversight.
