MASTER DISPOSAL SERVICE, INC., LANDFILL
Brookfield, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Master Disposal Service, Inc., operated a 40-acre landfill on the
western edge of Brookfield, Waukesha County, Wisconsin. The site was licensed by the State to receive
wastes in August 1977. Between 1962 and January 1982, the company filled a 26-acre wetland near
the banks of the Fox River with in excess of 1.5 million gallons of industrial wastes -- solvents, paints,
adhesives, oils, and foundry wastes. No wastes have been accepted for about 2 years.
 
State sampling established that ground water near the site is contaminated by chromium, lead, phenols,
and PCBs. A ditch drains from the site into the Fox River.
 
In 1977, the State signed a Stipulated Agreement requiring the company to develop and implement a
proper site abandonment plan.
 
Status (June 1984) : Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources and the Attorney General's Office have
been dealing with the company to bring it into compliance with the Stipulated Agreement.
 
EPA is conducting a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
