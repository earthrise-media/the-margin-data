NPL Site Narrative for Organic Chemicals,
Inc.
 
ORGANIC CHEMICALS, INC.
Grandville, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Organic Chemicals, Inc., occupies 20 acres in Grandville,
Michigan. The facility reclaims spent solvents and manufactures small quantities of various organic
chemicals. From at least September 1974 to June 1980, the facility discharged process waste water
and other water to a seepage lagoon on the site, contaminating ground water. Analyses detected 3,586
parts per million (ppm) total organic carbon, as well as methylene chloride, toluene, trichloroethylene,
1,1-dichloroethane, and almost 70 other substances. In April 1976, Organic Chemicals applied for a
State Ground Water Discharge Permit, which was granted in January 1977. It required monitoring for pH,
phenol, oil, and grease, and the diversion of process wastes to the Grandville Sanitary System. The permit
limits for these parameters were exceeded on several occasions. The State issued a Notice and Order
to Comply in 1977, when the company failed to comply with the permit time schedule. In late 1981, the
company removed accumulated sludges from the former cooling water pond on the site and filled it with
clean material.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through an enforcement action
against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
