NPL Site Narrative for Salem Acres
 
SALEM ACRES
Salem, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Salem Acres Site consists of four unlined, uncovered
disposal pits on 162 acres of land in the Town of Salem, Essex County, Massachusetts. The site operated
from 1946 to 1969. Wastes disposed of on-site include sludge, grit, and grease from a waste water
treatment plant, as well as tannery waste. PCBs, methylene chloride, arsenic, and chromium are present in
soils on the site, according to analyses conducted by EPA.
 
One of the disposal pits is approximately 20 feet from Strongwater Brook. The site lies on the divide of two
drainage basins that channel both surface water and ground water directly into two major aquifers. The
site is bounded on the south and east by residential housing. The owner has erected a gate on one of the
access roads leading to the site. Approximately 2,500 people reside within 1 mile of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : A party identified by the State as potentially responsible for wastes associated
with the site erected a fence around the pits after receiving a notice letter from the State. EPA is searching
for other potentially responsible parties. Late in 1985, EPA started to develop a workplan for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action.
