NPL Site Narrative for Selma Treating Co.
 
SELMA TREATING CO.
Selma, California
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Selma Treating Co. Site covers 12 acres about 0.5 mile
south of Selma, Fresno County, California. The site is in an area of single family residences, light industry,
and agriculture. Wood-treating operations began at the site in 1936. Pressure treating began in 1965.
Process wastes were discharged into an off-site drainage ditch, several on-site disposal wells, an unlined
pond. Preservative from treated wood and treatment vessels was dripped and spilled in numerous areas
on-site, and sludge scraped from tanks was placed in piles on-site. The owner of the company filed a
bankruptcy action in 1981. A new facility owner, Sawmill Properties, Inc., resumed partial operation in
1982.
 
Sampling indicates elevated levels of copper, chromium, arsenic, and pentachlorophenol in soil and ground
water, both on- and off-site. At 25 to 30 feet below the surface is an aquifer that is the sole source of water
in the area. The site is also in a ground water recharge zone.
 
In February 1981, EPA sent a letter (under Section 3007 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act)
to the owner requesting that the company (1) identify hazardous wastes generated, treated, or disposed
of, (2) identify products used, (3) describe operating processes, (4) provide maps, and (5) provide any
proposals for remedial measures. In March and May 1981, the company responded with the information
requested. In September 1981, the State issued a Cleanup and Abatement Order to the company. In
November 1982, Selma Leasing Co., the owner of the land, proposed a site monitoring plan.
 
Status (July 1983) : Results of the owner's monitoring plan are expected in July 1983.
