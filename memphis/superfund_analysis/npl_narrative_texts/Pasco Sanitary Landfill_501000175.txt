NPL Site Narrative for Pasco Sanitary
Landfill
 
PASCO SANITARY LANDFILL
Pasco, Washington
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Pasco Sanitary Landfill covers 250 acres 1.5 miles northeast of
Pasco, Franklin County, Washington, in an area dominated by irrigated agricultural fields and range land.
The landfill is privately owned and operated and was converted from a burning dump to a sanitary landfill
in 1971. Since 1982, it has had a conditional use permit from the Washington Department of Ecology
(WDOE) to accept municipal wastes.
 
In 1972, Resource Recovery Corp. leased a portion of the landfill and operated a regional hazardous waste
disposal site under a WDOE permit until December 1974, when the lease terminated.
 
According to WDOE files, over 47,000 drums of hazardous substances, including paint wastes, pesticides,
organic solvents, cadmium, and mercury, were deposited in the leased portion of the landfill. In 1974, the
area was covered by 3 feet of soil.
 
In 1985, EPA detected tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene in on-site ground water. A well on-site
supplies drinking water to two nearby residences. Ground water within 3 miles of the site is used by over
1,000 people for drinking and is also used to irrigate almost 10,000 acres of land.
 
In October 1986, WDOE issued an Administrative Order requiring Resource Recovery Corp. to monitor on-
site wells on a quarterly basis. The company is currently complying with the order.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : Resource Recovery Corp. has completed a hydrogeological evaluation of the
site and continues to monitor on-site wells on a quarterly basis.
