WASTE DISPOSAL ENGINEERING
Andover, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Waste Disposal Engineering (WDE) Site covers 114 acres in
Andover, Anoka County, Minnesota. About 6,600 drums of hazardous wastes were placed in a 0.2-acre pit
between November 1972 and January 1974. Ground water beneath the site in the upper sand aquifer is
highly contaminated. Contaminants include chlorinated organic compounds, benzene, and toluene. Since
1952, the rest of the landfill has handled municipal wastes.
 
Status (July 1983) : In January 1983, Melron, Inc., stopped operation of the landfill and is covering the site
with lime sludge. (WDE merged with other companies in May 1975.)
 
In June 1983, the State submitted a draft Cooperative Agreement to EPA for a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action. It is being reviewed.
