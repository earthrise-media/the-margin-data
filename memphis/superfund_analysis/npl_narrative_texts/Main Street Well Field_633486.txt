NPL Site Narrative for Main Street Well
Field
 
MAIN STREET WELL FIELD
Elkhart, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Main Street Well Field supplies water to Elkhart, Indiana. Of
the city's 21 production wells, the field has 15, providing 70 percent of the city's potable water. Christiana
Creek is diverted to numerous ponds, which recharge the shallow aquifer. All production wells drain from
this aquifer. Infiltration from the ponds is rapid. Though the St. Joseph River is the main discharge point for
the area, most of the ground water in the Main Street Well Field discharges to Christiana Creek.
 
Of the 15 wells, 5 are contaminated with from 50 to 880 micrograms per liter of trichlorethylene (TCE). The
contamination was discovered in April 1981. Sampling continued through 1982. Elkhart took several steps
that reduced TCE levels in the immediate vicinity of the well field and maintained adequate water supplies.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
