Refuse
 
NIAGARA COUNTY REFUSE
Wheatfield, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Niagara County Refuse Site is an inactive 50-acre landfill in
Wheatfield, New York. The landfill was operated by the county from 1968 until 1976. Large amounts of
industrial waste chemicals are alleged to have been buried on the site. Analysis of leachate and sediments
detected PCBs, chlorinated organics, and heavy metals. Contaminated run-off flows into Black Creek and
into the Niagara River about 5 miles upstream from the water intake that helps supply water to the 77,000
residents of Niagara Falls. Organic vapors are coming from the site, which is within 0.3 mile of private
residences.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA conducted a hydrogeological investigation of the site in April 1983. Results are
pending. EPA plans to perform any other studies needed to determine the extent of contamination.
