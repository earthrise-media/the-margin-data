NPL Site Narrative for Lee Chemical
 
LEE CHEMICAL
Liberty, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Lee Chemical Site is near the southern edge of Liberty,
Clay County, Missouri. During a drinking water study in 1980, EPA sampled the city's water wells, which
serve about 23,000 people. Analyses indicated the presence of trichloroethylene (TCE). Since then, the
most contaminated wells have not been used for drinking water. The water from the remaining wells is
treated to remove TCE.
 
Investigations by the city and the State identified the source of the TCE contamination as the abandoned
Lee Chemical Site, which is within 2,300 feet of the wells. Lee Chemical packaged a variety of chemicals
on the site from about 1966 to 1974. As a result of bad housekeeping practices, soil in an area of less than
1 acre is contaminated with TCE.
 
The city, which owns the property, has removed the building and visible chemicals from the site and taken
soil samples. The analyses indicate TCE is still on-site.
 
The State anticipates the need to excavate soil, as well as purge the aquifer.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : A multisite cooperative agreement between EPA and the State covering five
sites, including Lee Chemical, was approved on September 9, 1985. Initial funding provides for planning
activities. The City of Liberty is pumping the most contaminated well and disposing of the contaminated
water under a permit issued by the State under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.
