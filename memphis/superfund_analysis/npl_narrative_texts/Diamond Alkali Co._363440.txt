NPL Site Narrative for Diamond Alkali Co.
 
DIAMOND ALKALI CO.
Newark, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Diamond Alkali Co. Site occupies about 1 acre immediately
adjacent to the Passaic River, in Newark, Essex County, New Jersey. From 1943 through 1968, the
company manufactured numerous chemicals on the site, including 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, which is likely to
contain dioxin as an impurity. Extensive sampling conducted by EPA and the State has detected extremely
high concentrations of dioxin on and off the site. EPA and the State have covered the area of major
contamination with plastic tarpaulins. Adjacent transportation routes and residential areas were swept
and vacuumed. Workers may have been exposed to dioxin during normal operations, as well as during
renovations conducted during the summer of 1982. Another company has since purchased the land.
 
The area is both densely populated and heavily industrialized. Municipal water is drawn from the Wanaque
Reservoir, roughly 35 miles from the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : On March 13, 1984, the State and Diamond entered into an Administrative Order on
Consent for a remedial investigation/feasibility study and for on-site cleanup.
