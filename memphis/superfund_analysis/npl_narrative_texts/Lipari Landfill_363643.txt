NPL Site Narrative for Lipari Landfill
 
LIPARI LANDFILL
Pitman, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Lipari Landfill is an inactive landfill occupying a 6-acre former
gravel pit in Pitman, New Jersey. The site is in an area of fruit orchards. From 1958 to 1971, domestic and
industrial wastes, including various toxic organic compounds and heavy metals, were dumped at the site.
They percolated into the ground water under the landfill and leached into Chestnut Branch, Rabbit Run,
and Alcyon Lake.
 
In fall 1981, EPA completed a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : Between 1980 and 1982, using $726,000 made available by Section 311 of the Clean
Water Act, EPA's Office of Research and Development, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act, EPA studied leachate distribution, drilled and sampled 16 wells, and evaluated various cleanup
alternatives. In 1982, using $125,000 in CERCLA emergency funds, EPA installed over 2,000 feet of
security fencing around the site. An additional 1,600 feet must still be installed.
 
In September 1982, EPA signed a $1,689,150 Superfund State Contract with New Jersey to complete
design of the remedial alternative selected in the feasibility study and undertake the construction activities.
The work is being supervised by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Construction is scheduled to start in
the third quarter of 1983.
 
The remedial action is divided into two phases. The first phase calls for (1) an underground slurry wall
encircling a 16-acre area to prevent ground water from leaving or entering and (2) a bentonite clay cap.
The second phase evaluates the need to collect ground water from within the enclosure and transport it to
a nearby public sewage treatment plant. A decision on the second phase will be made after completion of a
study on the compatibility of the ground water to be treated with the collection and treatment systems of the
sewage plant.
 
In July 1982, the Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, entered into a Consent Decree with the owner
under Section 7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
