NPL Site Narrative for Washington County
Landfill
 
WASHINGTON COUNTY LANDFILL
Lake Elmo, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Washington County Landfill is located south of Lake Jane
in Lake Elmo, Washington County, Minnesota. It operated on a 40-acre site from 1969 to 1975, when it
was closed and covered. The facility, owned and operated by Washington and Ramsey Counties, was not
licensed to accept hazardous substances. Analyses by the State indicate that on-site monitoring wells and
residential wells along the southwestern edge of the property are contaminated with chlorinated solvents.
The State has closed three residential wells because of excessive levels of these solvents and is closely
monitoring others nearby.
 
Status (June 1984) : The two counties are funding a barrier control well on the southwestern portion of the
site to intercept contaminated ground water before it reaches the residential wells. The State is negotiating
a Consent Agreement with the counties regarding a solution to the ground water problem.
