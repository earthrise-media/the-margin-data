TRI-CITY OIL CONSERVATIONIST, INC.
Tampa, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 8, 1983) : Tri-City Oil Conservationist, Inc., recycles waste oil at a
0.25-acre site in Tampa, Hillsborough County, Florida. The site is about 3,000 feet from the Hillsborough
River and within 3 miles of the public well field serving the community's 16,000 residents. About 35 people
served by nine private wells live within one block of the site.
 
About 260 cubic yards of oil and sludge cover the ground at the site. An above-ground storage facility
holds 16,000 gallons of waste oil. Sampling performed by the State indicates high levels of heavy metals in
the oily wastes.
 
Status (September 21, 1984) : In February 1984, EPA used $40,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to
remove all surface wastes. Also in February, EPA issued an Administrative Order to the responsible parties
informing them that their activities represent an imminent and substantial danger to public health and the
environment and that they must act promptly to stop those activities.
 
Status (September 1, 1988) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Florida, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
