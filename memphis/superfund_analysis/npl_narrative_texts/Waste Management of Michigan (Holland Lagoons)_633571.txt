NPL Site Narrative for Waste Management
of Michigan (Holland Lagoons)
 
WASTE MANAGEMENT OF MICHIGAN (HOLLAND LAGOONS)
Holland, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Waste Management of Michigan lagoons cover 160
acres north of Holland, Ottawa County, Michigan. From 1971 to 1980, the company deposited liquid
industrial wastes (including metal hydroxides and vinegar production wastes) and waste water treatment
sludge into seepage lagoons at the site. In February 1979, all surface wastes were removed from the site.
 
One residential well in the area has been contaminated with up to 67 parts per billion trichloroethylene,
according to tests conducted by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. This residence is now
served by municipal water.
 
Operations of Southwest Ottawa County Landfill, located to the north and west of the former lagoon area,
have contaminated ground water, according to the State. Ground water moves to the southwest, passing
directly through the former lagoon area. It is difficult to identify sources for any contamination downgradient
of the lagoons because many of the dewatered sludges from the lagoon area, as well as other industrial
solids of a similar nature, were disposed of at the county landfill. The State, Ottawa County, and the
company have installed approximately 60 monitoring wells in the area.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
