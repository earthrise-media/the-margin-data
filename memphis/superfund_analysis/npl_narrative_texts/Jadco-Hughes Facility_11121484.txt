NPL Site Narrative for Jadco-Hughes
Facility
 
JADCO-HUGHES FACILITY
Belmont, North Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Jadco-Hughes Facility covers about 6 acres in Belmont,
Gaston County, North Carolina. Chemical wastes were received from industries and reprocessed to
recover whatever could be resold. The residues remaining were deposited in a landfill on the site.
 
About 8,000 to 10,000 drums had accumulated by August 1975, when the company stopped operating.
The drums were stacked at several locations and were in various states of deterioration. Several large
storage tanks were also on-site.
 
Analyses conducted by EPA revealed the presence of cyanide, arsenic, copper, lead, methylene chloride,
and toluene in soil samples taken from the site. It appears likely that the contaminants will migrate into
ground water since the landfill was unlined and approximately 6 feet above the water table. Approximately
4,700 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In July 1985, EPA identified over 30 parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site.
