NPL Site Narrative for Charlevoix
Municipal Well
 
CHARLEVOIX MUNICIPAL WELL
Charlevoix, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The 5,000 residents of the City of Charlevoix, Michigan,
are served by one municipal well. In September 1981, the State detected 37 parts per billion of
trichloroethylene (TCE) in the well. In November 1981, the city installed four monitoring wells around the
municipal well, which also detected TCE. A study by EPA in mid-1982 identified three possible sources of
contamination, but could not define the actual source.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently prepared a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
