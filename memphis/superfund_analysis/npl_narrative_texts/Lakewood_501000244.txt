NPL Site Narrative for Lakewood
 
LAKEWOOD
Lakewood, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Lakewood Site covers about 1 square mile, including a 1-
acre laundry identified as a source, in Lakewood, Pierce County, Washington. In 1981, two major wells
of the Lakewood Water District, which serves more than 10,000 people, were found to be contaminated
by chlorinated organic compounds. The district closed the wells and used other uncontaminated wells to
satisfy its needs.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA determined that the contaminants are components of degreasers, solvents, and
other substances in common industrial use. EPA drilled 25 test wells in the Ponder's Corner-McChord Air
Force Base area. Of the 25, only three were contaminated. A plume was found in ground water indicating
one source and the direction from which the contaminants were coming. The State ordered a commercial
dry cleaners to remove the contaminated soil from its property and cease discharging solvents. Future
options include keeping the wells closed or treating and restoring them to use. Ground water monitoring in
the area is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
