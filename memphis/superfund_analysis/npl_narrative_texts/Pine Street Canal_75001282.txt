NPL Site Narrative for Pine Street Canal
 
PINE STREET CANAL
Burlington, Vermont
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Pine Street Canal Site covers 30 acres of partially filled
wetland bordering an abandoned shipping canal (Pine Street Canal) and Lake Champlain in Burlington,
Vermont. In 1906, a coal gasification plant began operating on Pine Street, southeast of the canal. There is
evidence that residual oil and wood chips saturated with organic compounds were disposed of in the Pine
Street Canal wetland. During the 1960s and early 1970s, an oil-like material was detected seeping from the
wetland into Pine Street Canal, Barnes Basin, and Maltex Pond. The State detected high levels of organic
compounds associated with coal tar at several locations on the site, which is along the proposed location of
a portion of a major highway. The State is concerned that construction will release organic compounds to
the canal and possibly to Lake Champlain, the source of Burlington's drinking water.
 
This is the top priority site in Vermont.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed
to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. At the same time, it is searching for parties
potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
