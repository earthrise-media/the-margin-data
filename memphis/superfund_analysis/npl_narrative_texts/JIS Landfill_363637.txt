NPL Site Narrative for JIS Landfill
 
JIS LANDFILL
Jamesburg, South Brunswick Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Jones Industrial Service (JIS) operated a landfill in an agricultural
area of Jamesburg/South Brunswick Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey. The landfill, originally a
borrow pit, received liquid chemical wastes from the 1960s until the State closed it in 1980. Investigations
indicate that numerous drums of solvents may also have been buried at the site. Volatile organics have
contaminated the Old Bridge Formation Aquifer, and the contaminated ground water plume has migrated
off-site. One residential well has been closed, and others are threatened.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has an ongoing judicial action aimed at requiring the owner/operator to
properly cap the site and decontaminate the ground water.
