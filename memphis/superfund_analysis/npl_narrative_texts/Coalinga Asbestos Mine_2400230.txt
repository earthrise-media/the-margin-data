Mine
 
COALINGA ASBESTOS MINE
Coalinga, California
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Coalinga Asbestos Mine operated from 1963 to 1978 on a
3-acre site about 17 miles northwest of Coalinga, Fresno County, California. The abandoned site consists
of the asbestos mine, a processing mill, support buildings, and asbestos tailings. Pine Canyon Creek
drains the site into Los Gatos Creek, a tributary to the Arroyo Pasajero, a flood area along the California
Aqueduct. During the rainy season, the California State Department of Water Resources drains the Arroyo
into the aqueduct. Analysis of the water in the aqueduct, conducted by the Southern California Metropolitan
Water District and the Department of Water Resources, indicates high concentrations of asbestos fibers.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA has conducted remedial planning activities for this site. The purpose was
to review the scope of a remedial action plan being proposed by the owner of the site, define areas of
insufficient data, and review the proposed remedial action for consistency with the National Contingency
Plan. EPA and the Regional Water Quality Control Board are continuing review of the proposed remedial
action plan.
