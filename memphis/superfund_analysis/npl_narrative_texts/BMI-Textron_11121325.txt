NPL Site Narrative for BMI-Textron
 
BMI-TEXTRON
Lake Park, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 1988) : The BMI-Textron Site covers 3 acres at 1121 Silver Beach Road,
Lake Park, Palm Beach County, Florida. The facility began operation in October 1969 under the name
Basic Microelectronics, Inc. In 1981, the site was sold to Textron, Inc., and began operation under the
name BMI-Textron. Operations stopped in January 1986.
 
The facility manufactured chrome-backed glass plates used in producing electronic components. The
process involved cutting, washing, and polishing glass plates before chrome was deposited. Cyanide was
used in the glass-etching process. Liquid waste from the process was discharged to percolation ponds and
drain fields under a 4-year industrial waste water treatment permit issued on November 17, 1980, by the
Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (DER). Four wells were installed at the facility to monitor
permit compliance. On November 10, 1983, BMI-Textron received a Notice of Violation from the Florida
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services for excessive levels of nitrates and total dissolved solids,
as well as pH below the allowable limits.
 
In August 1984, BMI submitted data to DER showing cyanide contamination of soil and ground water
at the site. On December 20, 1984, BMI-Textron and DER entered into a Consent Agreement requiring
the company to remove contaminated soils at the site and to submit a detailed monitoring program for
determining the nature and extent of ground water contamination at the site. BMI-Textron removed
approximately 680 cubic yards of cyanide-contaminated soil and transported it to a hazardous waste facility
regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
 
In January 1986, DER found cyanide and fluoride in three on-site monitoring wells and in soil near
percolation pond #2. On November 18, 1986, BMI-Textron agreed to comply with another DER Consent
Order to develop a plan to clean up contaminated ground water. BMI-Textron submitted an "Investigative
and Cleanup Proposal" on January 6, 1987, in response to the November Consent Order.
 
Two municipal water systems drawing from wells within 3 miles of the site serve an estimated 108,000
people in Lake Park, Riviera Beach, North Palm Beach, and Palm Beach Gardens.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : BMI-Textron submitted an "Interim Remedial Action Plan, Soil Removal Plan" in
February 1990. In accordance with the DER Consent Order of November 1986, the company is removing
contaminated soils from percolation pond #2. In February 1990, BMI-Textron also prepared an "Evaluation
of the Risks to Human Health."
