NPL Site Narrative for U.S. Aviex
 
U.S. AVIEX
Howard Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The U.S. Aviex Co. Site covers 2 acres in Howard Township,
Cass County, Michigan. The company produces various automobile solvents. In 1972, several residential
wells southwest of the plant were contaminated with ether from a leaking transmission line on-site. The line
was repaired, and the company replaced three wells. In November 1978, fire destroyed most of the facility
and released a number of organic compounds into the soil and ground water. Dichloromethane, benzene,
toluene, and other chemicals were detected in nearby residential wells. In early 1982, the State filed suit
against the company. The court ordered U.S. Aviex to conduct a pump test in preparation for possible
purging and treatment of contaminated ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : U.S. Aviex completed the court-ordered test in spring 1983 and has begun purging
operations.
