NPL Site Narrative for M&T Delisa Landfill
 
M&T DELISA LANDFILL
Asbury Park, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The M & T Delisa Landfill operated on a 132-acre site in Asbury
Park, New Jersey, from about 1945 to 1975. It reportedly received only municipal waste. In 1976, the
Seaview Square Mall was constructed on 25 to 30 acres. Although the mall itself is situated on clean fill,
the parking lot is built on garbage. Methane gas vents are located around the parking lot, and a leachate
collection system runs underneath it. EPA inspectors have frequently observed leachate streams and
seepages discharging into a nearby stream which empties into Deal Lake less than 1 mile away. This
fresh water lake is occasionally used for recreational fishing. In June 1981, EPA found that ground water,
surface water, and soil are contaminated by polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and metals. Private water
wells surround the site and may be threatened.
 
Status (July 1983) : In May 1983, the mall and surrounding outside areas were tested for methane gas
migration. The results indicate a plume of methane exists about 1 to 3 feet below the ground, outside the
mall. The mall owners are installing about four vents in the area of known methane migration.
 
EPA is preparing a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup
required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
