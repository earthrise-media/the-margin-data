NPL Site Narrative for Hanford 200-Area
(USDOE)
 
HANFORD 200-AREA (USDOE)
Benton County, Washington
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Hanford 200-Area is in the middle of the 570-square-mile
Hanford Site approximately 20 miles north of the City of Richland, Benton County, Washington. Since
1943, Hanford has been the scene of Federal nuclear activities, primarily production of nuclear materials
for national defense.
 
The U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) uses the 200-Area for nuclear fuel reprocessing, finishing, and
waste management. Over 230 waste disposal locations have been identified in the 200-Area. The disposal
locations and plumes of contaminated ground water cover approximately 215 square miles.
 
An estimated 1 billion cubic yards of solid and dilute liquid wastes comprised of radioactive, mixed, and
hazardous constituents were disposed of in trenches, ditches, and landfills in the 200-Area. USDOE
has detected tritium, iodine-129, uranium, cyanide, and carbon tetrachloride at levels significantly above
background in ground water beneath the area. Over 2,500 people obtain drinking water from wells within
3 miles of the 200-Area. Tritium has been detected in Richland's surface water intakes at levels above
background. Surface water within 3 miles of the 200-Area provides drinking water to 70,000 people and
irrigates over 1,000 acres.
 
EPA, USDOE, and the Washington Department of Ecology (WDOE) are jointly developing an action plan
that will include the work needed to address this area under the Superfund program, as well as other work
needed to meet permitting, corrective action, and compliance requirements of Subtitle C of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : On May 15, 1989, EPA, USDOE, and WDOE signed a comprehensive
agreement for the cleanup of the entire Hanford Site, including the area covered in this NPL site. This
Federal Facility Agreement and State Consent Order contains schedules for remedial investigations and
feasibility studies for Superfund work at the Hanford Site.
