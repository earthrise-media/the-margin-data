NPL Site Narrative for Geiger (C & M Oil)
 
GEIGER (C & M OIL)
Rantoules, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Geiger Site, previously known as the C & M Oil Site,
occupies about 5 acres in the small community of Rantowles, South Carolina. The site, an abandoned
waste oil facility, consists of 7 unlined pits (each roughly 50 feet wide, 100 feet long, and 1 to 2 feet deep)
containing about 35,000 gallons of a waste oil/water mixture. EPA analysis of the mixture indicated the
presence of trichloroethane and dimethylbenzene. To the east of the pits is a pond with an outlet to the
north. Run-off from the site flows through substantial hardwood swamps and estuarine marshes before
emptying into Wallace River.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA has completed a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes associated
with the site. A financial assessment of the parties is pending.
 
A remedial investigation/feasibility study is under consideration. It would determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
