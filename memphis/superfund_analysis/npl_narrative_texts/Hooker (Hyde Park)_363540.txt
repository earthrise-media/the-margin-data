NPL Site Narrative for Hooker (Hyde Park)
 
HOOKER (HYDE PARK)
Niagara Falls, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Hooker's Hyde Park landfill covers 16 acres in Niagara Falls,
Niagara County, New York, only a few blocks east of a 500-home residential community. About 80,000
tons of chemical wastes were dumped at this site, owned by Occidental Chemicals Corp. (OCC--formerly
known as Hooker Chemicals and Plastics Corp.). The wastes include hexachlorocyclo-pentadiene (C-56),
trichlorophenols, and chlorinated benzofluorides.
 
Monitoring data show that surface water and ground water have been contaminated by wastes leaching
from this landfill. Dioxin has been found in the sediment taken from Bloody Run Creek, which drains the
site. This creek runs through the residential community and discharges into the Niagara River gorge.
 
On January 19, 1981, the Federal and State Governments and OCC signed a Consent Decree. This
agreement, which became effective on July 1, 1982, specifies the process by which OCC will remedy the
problems at the site, maintain these remedies, and ensure that they remain effective.
 
Status (July 1983) : Hooker is currently implementing the measures specified in the consent agreement.
