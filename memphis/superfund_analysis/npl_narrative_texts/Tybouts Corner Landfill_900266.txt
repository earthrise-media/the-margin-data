NPL Site Narrative for Tybouts Corner
Landfill
 
TYBOUTS CORNER LANDFILL
New Castle County, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Tybouts Corner Landfill, New Castle County, Delaware, is the
site of a former sand and gravel operation. From 1969 to 1971, the 50-acre site, which is privately
owned, accepted municipal and industrial wastes. Surface water and ground water are contaminated with
hazardous organic and inorganic substances. The area is highly dependent on ground water. In 1976,
the State issued demand letters to parties responsible for wastes associated with the site and requested
that they take measures to remedy the ground water contamination problem. The parties refused to take
responsibility.
 
This is the top priority site in Delaware.
 
Status (July 1983) : In January 1983, EPA signed a $755,000 Superfund State Contract with Delaware for
a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of
1984.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, has brought a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief
against parties responsible for wastes associated with the site.
