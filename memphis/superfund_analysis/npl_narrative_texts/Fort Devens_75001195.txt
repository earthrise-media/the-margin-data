NPL Site Narrative for Fort Devens
 
FORT DEVENS
Fort Devens, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at proposal (July 14, 1989) : Fort Devens is 35 miles west of Boston, Massachusetts, at the
intersection of four townships: Ayer and Shirley (in Middlesex County) and Lancaster and Harvard (in
Worcester County). The area is largely rural residential.
 
Founded in 1917, Fort Devens has as its primary mission the training of active duty personnel to support
various Army units. Fort Devens Sudbury Training Annex, 12 miles to the southwest, is also being
proposed for the NPL at this time.
 
Fort Devens covers 9,416 acres and can be divided into three areas: the 1,013-acre North Post; the 3,247-
acre Cold Spring Brook Area, which is in the central part of the fort; and the 5,156-acre South Post. The
first two areas are separated by West Main Street between Shirley and Ayer; the Cold Spring Brook area
and South Post are separated by State Route 2.
 
Fort Devens is participating in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), established in 1978. Under
this program, the Department of Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination from
hazardous materials. IRP studies have identified 46 potential hazardous waste areas including: the 15-
acre Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) range, where explosives and unusable munitions have been
detonated or burned in open unlined pits since 1979; the 50-acre sanitary landfill, where household wastes,
military refuse, asbestos, construction debris, waste oil, and incinerator ash have been dumped since the
1930s; and Building 1650, where battery acids, PCBs, pesticides, and solvents have been stored.
 
Monitoring wells near the sanitary landfill contain cadmium, lead, mercury, iron, and arsenic, according to
tests conducted in 1987 by an Army contractor. An estimated 21,700 fort employees and Ayer residents
obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the landfill; a Fort Devens well is 1,670 feet from the
sanitary landfill.
 
The 1987 tests also found arsenic, chromium, nickel, and lead in surface water near the sanitary landfill.
An 8-mile section of the Nashua River lies within the fort's boundaries. The 630-acre Oxbow National
Wildlife Refuge is in the east central portion of Fort Devens on land the Army deeded to the Department of
the Interior in 1973. An 83-acre wetland is in the refuge northeast of EOD.
 
Status (November 21, 1989) : IRP activities continue.
