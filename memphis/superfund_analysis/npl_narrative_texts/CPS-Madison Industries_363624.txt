NPL Site Narrative for CPS/Madison
Industries
 
CPS/MADISON INDUSTRIES
Old Bridge Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The CPS/Madison Industries Site covers 35 acres in Old Bridge
Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey. Since 1967, these companies have repeatedly dumped and
discharged chemicals into the public sewer system, as well as onto their respective properties. The State
estimates that about 400 tons of hazardous wastes have been dumped, including organic chemicals (for
example, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, bromoform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and methylene chloride) and
heavy metals (for example, cadmium and lead). Both surface water and ground water are contaminated.
 
Through a Middlesex County Superior court decision (October 15, 1981), the State has begun the process
of remedying the surface water and ground water problems associated with this site. The court order
directs the two companies to reimburse the State for costs it incurs for site cleanup or containment.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State continues to work on the cleanup.
