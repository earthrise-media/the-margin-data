Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Universal Oil Products (Chemical Division) once manufactured
specialty chemicals on an 85-acre site in East Rutherford, Bergen County, New Jersey. The company
razed the plant in 1980. Waste solvents and solid chemical wastes were dumped into two unlined lagoons,
which were later filled in. Surface water, ground water, and a large quantity of soils are contaminated.

Township.
 
The site is in the coastal wetland management area of the Hackensack River Basin. It is bordered on
the southeast by Berry's Creek; one of its tributaries, Ackerman's Creek, passes through the site. Berry's
Creek joins the Hackensack River about 3.5 miles downstream. Surface waters are used for recreation.
