NPL Site Narrative for Sarney Farm
 
SARNEY FARM
Amenia, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Sarney Farm is in Amenia, Dutchess County, New York.
The site is an open dump in farmland, with several small villages close by. A former owner used a 35-acre
section of the property as a dump for municipal and industrial wastes. The operation had no permit. The
site received drums of ethylene dichloride, cleaning solvents, inks, acids, water-base glue, and machine oil
between 1965 and 1969, according to the county. Some drums are on the surface, and others are buried.
 
Contamination of both ground water and surface water is of concern. About 4,500 people draw drinking
water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
The site is 500 feet from Cleaver Swamp, which in the past provided water for farm livestock.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and to identify alternatives for remedial action.
