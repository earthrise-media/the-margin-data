NPL Site Narrative for Westlake Landfill
 
WESTLAKE LANDFILL
Bridgeton, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : Westlake Landfill covers 200 acres in Bridgeton, St.
Louis County, Missouri, about 16 miles northwest of downtown St. Louis. The area is adjacent to prime
agricultural land and is in the floodplain of the Missouri River. Between 1939 and the spring of 1987,
limestone was quarried on the site. Starting in 1962, portions of the property were used for landfilling of
solid and liquid industrial wastes, municipal refuse, and construction debris. In 1973, Cotter Corp. disposed
of over 43,000 tons of uranium ore processing residues and soil in two areas covering a total of 16 acres of
the Westlake Landfill, according to a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) report published in 1977.
 
In 1976, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) closed the unregulated landfill. Since
then, MDNR has issued several permits for various portions of the 200-acre site. Currently, an operating
sanitary landfill has a permitted area of 52 acres, and an operating demolition landfill has a permitted area
of 22 acres.
 
Uranium was detected in on-site monitoring wells in tests conducted in 1985 and 1986 by a consultant to
the owner of the landfill. An estimated 60 people obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of
the site.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : EPA is monitoring investigations by NRC and Cotter Corp. of potential
remedies for the site.
