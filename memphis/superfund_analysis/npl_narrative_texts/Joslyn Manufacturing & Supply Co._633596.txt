NPL Site Narrative for Joslyn
Manufacturing & Supply Co.
 
JOSLYN MANUFACTURING & SUPPLY CO.
Brooklyn Center, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Joslyn Manufacturing & Supply Co. treated wood on a 93-acre
site adjacent to Twin Lakes in the urban community of Brooklyn Center, Hennepin County, Minnesota.
The plant, which operated from 1920 to 1980, used processes involving creosote, pentachlorophenol, and
copper-arsenic solution. Before the 1960s, the plant was called Consolidated Pole Treating Co. and before
the 1940s, Naugle Pole and Tie Co.
 
In 1944, this facility discharged its waste water to a marshy area connected to Twin Lakes. Later,
an unlined surface impoundment adjacent to the marsh was used. In the 1970s, an oil reclamation
unit preceded the surface impoundment. In 1976, 216,000 gallons were discharged to the surface
impoundment. Waste sludge has also been buried on the site. Sampling and analysis conducted for
Brooklyn Center in 1961 and by the State in 1980 showed that a number of nearby residential wells are
contaminated by phenol and pentachlorophenol.
 
Joslyn completed a ground water investigation in October 1981.
 
Status (June 1984) : In September 1983, the State issued a Request for Response Action to Joslyn
which requires the company to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The company continues to
negotiate with the State.
