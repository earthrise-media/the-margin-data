NPL Site Narrative for Denver Radium Site
 
DENVER RADIUM SITE
Denver, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : A 1915 U.S. Bureau of Mines report refers to a National
Radium Institute in Denver, which led to the identification of 35 Colorado properties where radium was
processed, refined, or fabricated into various devices or products. Of these properties, 31 are located
in the metropolitan Denver area and include vacant land, industrial operations, buildings, and public
streets. Other disposition of this radioactive residue is still unknown. All locations have varying levels of
radioactivity. In June 1981, using funds available under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
EPA awarded a $100,000 Cooperative Agreement to Colorado, and added $178,600 in September 1981.
The funds were to (1) conduct remedial investigations to determine the extent and type of contamination
within each of the 31 Denver properties and (2) undertake design activities at 9.
 
Status (July 1983) : In August 1982, EPA provided an additional $15,000 in contract support for a
feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action at the properties. EPA plans to spend about
$250,000 to extend the remedial investigation outside the boundaries of six properties and to complete a
feasibility study consistent with CERCLA guidelines. Studies of five properties have been completed; the
remaining 26 are scheduled for completion by the third quarter of 1984.
