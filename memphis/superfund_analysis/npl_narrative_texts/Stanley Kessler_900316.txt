NPL Site Narrative for Stanley Kessler
 
STANLEY KESSLER
King of Prussia, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Stanley Kessler Site is in King of Prussia, Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania. From 1962 to 1978, solvent wastes were disposed of via a floor drain into a septic
tank-cesspool system. This practice resulted in contamination of ground water with organic compounds
such as chloroform and trichloroethylene. The ground water in the area feeds the Upper Merion Reservoir,
which supplies drinking water to approximately 170,000 people.
 
Status (July 1983) : The company removed the septic tank and cesspool. EPA is negotiating with the
company for complete site cleanup.
