NPL Site Narrative for Seneca Army Depot
 
SENECA ARMY DEPOT
Romulus, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (July 14, 1989) : The Seneca Army Depot encompasses more than 10,000 acres
in Seneca County, New York. It lies between Cayuga and Seneca Lakes in the Finger Lakes region and
abuts the town of Romulus. The Army has stored and disposed of military explosives at the facility since its
inception in 1941.
 
Seneca Army Depot is participating in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), established in 1978.
Under this program, the Department of Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination
from hazardous materials.
 
During preliminary investigations, the Army identified a number of potentially contaminated areas, including
an unlined 13-acre landfill in the west-central portion of the depot, where solid waste and incinerator ash
were disposed of intermittently for 30 years during 1941-79; two incinerator pits adjacent to the landfill,
where refuse was burned at least once a week during 1941-74; a 90-acre open burning/detonation area in
the northwest portion of the depot, where explosives and related wastes have been burned and detonated
during the past 30 years; and the APE-1236 Deactivation Furnace in the east-central portion of the depot,
where small arms are destroyed.
 
Monitoring wells on the depot downgradient of the old landfill contain elevated concentrations of trans-1,2-
dichloroethylene and trichloroethylene, according to tests conducted in 1987 by an Army contractor. An
estimated 1,350 people obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the depot.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : EPA, the State, and the Army are negotiating an Interagency Agreement under
CERCLA Section 120 to cover future activities at the depot.
 
The Army plans to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. Field work is scheduled to start in the
fall of 1990.
