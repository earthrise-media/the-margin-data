NPL Site Narrative for Chemical Leaman
Tank Lines, Inc.
 
CHEMICAL LEAMAN TANK LINES, INC.
Bridgeport, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc. (proposed for listing as
Chemical Leaman Tank Liners, Inc.) has operated a tank-washing facility (including cleaning the interior
and exterior of trailers) since 1960 on a 2-acre site in Bridgeport, New Jersey. The waste water generated
was placed in a series of six lagoons and ultimately discharged to Moss Creek. In 1975, sludge in the
settling lagoons was excavated and disposed of off-site. They were then filled in. The aeration lagoons
were filled in, but no sludge was removed. In 1980-81, the State found carbon tetrachloride and other
organics in ground water on the site, as well as in private wells.
 
The State is currently negotiating with the owner for cleanup of the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
