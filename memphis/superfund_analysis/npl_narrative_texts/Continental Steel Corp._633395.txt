NPL Site Narrative for Continental Steel
Corp.
 
CONTINENTAL STEEL CORP.
Kokomo, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Continental Steel Corp. formerly operated on a 200-acre
site at 111 South Main Street in a mixed-use area of Kokomo, Howard County, Indiana. Since 1914,
the manufacturing processes and products have varied, but for much of its recent history Continental
manufactured rods and wire products from low- and high-carbon steel recycled from steel scrap. Waste
pickle liquor was collected in a 10-acre, 20-million-gallon surface impoundment constructed in 1946. The
contents were processed through a neutralization system and discharged to Wildcat Creek.
 
In 1984, 1985, and 1986, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management identified chromium,
cadmium, lead, and iron, constituents known to be in the impoundment, in on-site ground water. An
estimated 1,600 people obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the site. The nearest well
is 7,200 feet from the site.
 
Continental Steel filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code on November
25, 1985, and ceased operations on February 21, 1986. The bankruptcy was converted to Chapter 7 on
February 25, 1986.
 
The facility acquired Interim Status under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) when the owner filed a Notification of Hazardous Waste Activity and Part A of a permit application.
This site is being proposed for the NPL because it satisfies a component of EPA's NPL/RCRA policy: the
owner has demonstrated inability to finance appropriate remedial action by invoking bankruptcy laws.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
