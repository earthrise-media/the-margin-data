NPL Site Narrative for Pickettville Road
Landfill
 
PICKETTVILLE ROAD LANDFILL
Jacksonville, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Pickettville Road Landfill covers 53 acres near Jacksonville,
Florida. It began operation on a limited basis in the early 1940s. Full-scale operation started in 1967 and
stopped in 1977. The landfill received all types of waste, ranging from household garbage to hazardous
materials. Local residents complained of run-off problems from the landfill, and leachate streams also were
reported. Initially, monitoring wells in the area detected iron and chromium. Local private wells serving
approximately 1,000 people are free of contamination. No public water supply is available to residents in
the area. In June 1981, EPA found ground water contamination to a depth of 80 feet.
 
Status (July 1983) : Jacksonville installed additional monitoring wells around the site. Recent sampling
indicates one monitoring well contains excess lead. A leachate stream containing low levels of pyrene and
fluoranthene has been controlled by filling and grading the area where the landfill was eroding.
