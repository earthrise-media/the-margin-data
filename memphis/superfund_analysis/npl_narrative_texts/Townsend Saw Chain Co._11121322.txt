NPL Site Narrative for Townsend Saw
Chain Co.
 
TOWNSEND SAW CHAIN CO.
Pontiac, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Townsend Saw Chain Co. Site covers over 2 acres at
the intersection of State Route 53 and I-20 in Pontiac, Richland County, South Carolina. Information the
company provided to EPA, as required by CERCLA Section 103(c), indicates that wastes containing heavy
metals and solvents were disposed of at the site. During 1969-81, the company discharged large amounts
of chromium waste onto the ground.
 
A July 1985 South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) investigation
revealed elevated levels of cadmium and chromium in ground water at the site. Also, a surface water
sample near a spring at the site contained high levels of chromium and volatile organic chemicals,
including 1,1-dichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene.
 
Private wells within 3 miles of the site provide drinking water to an estimated 1,400 people. The nearest
well is less than 0.4 mile from the site. A private well near the site was closed in 1981-82 and the home
connected to the public water system.
 
Woodcreek Lake is within 2 miles downstream of the site and is used for recreational activities. Additional
surface water systems potentially affected by the site include two creeks, a pond, and fresh water
wetlands.
 
Since November 15, 1982, the company has been pumping contaminated ground water to the surface,
treating it to remove chromium, and spraying the treated water into a wooded area.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
