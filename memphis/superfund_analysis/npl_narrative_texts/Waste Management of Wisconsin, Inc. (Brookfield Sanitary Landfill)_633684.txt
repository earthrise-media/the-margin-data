WASTE MANANGEMENT OF WISCONSIN, INC. (BROOKFIELD
SANITARY LANDFILL)
Brookfield, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Waste Management of Wisconsin, Inc., operated a 20-acre
sanitary landfill in Brookfield, Waukesha County, Wisconsin, during 1969-81. The company leased the site
before purchasing it in 1982. Previously it had been a sand and gravel pit. In 1976, Waste Management
received a permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources to accept municipal waste.
 
Ground water on and off the site is contaminated with cyanide, according to EPA tests conducted in 1985.
An estimated 11,000 people obtain drinking water from public and private wells within 3 miles of the site,
the nearest within 1,000 feet.
 
Poplar Creek, 3,600 feet southwest of the site, is used for recreational activities. A wetland is 1,800 feet to
the southeast.
 
In 1985, Waste Management upgraded the landfill's system for extracting and burning soil gas, and in 1986
installed a clay cap.
 
The site is not completely fenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact
with hazardous substances.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : Waste Management is again upgrading the soil gas extraction and combustion
system. As part of the work, the clay cover is being repaired where needed.
