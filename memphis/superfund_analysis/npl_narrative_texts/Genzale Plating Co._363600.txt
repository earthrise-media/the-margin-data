NPL Site Narrative for Genzale Plating Co.
 
GENZALE PLATING CO.
Franklin Square, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Genzale Plating Co. Site covers approximately 0.5 acre
in Franklin Square on Long Island, Nassau County, New York. Starting in about 1915, the company
discharged waste water containing heavy metals, including chromium, copper, nickel, and zinc, to three
leaching pools in the rear of the site.
 
In 1981, the Nassau County Health Department ordered the company to stop the discharge. The company
complied with this order. In 1983, the company hauled sludge in the pools and some contaminated soil to
an approved disposal site.
 
Soil on the site is permeable, thus threatening a Franklin Square Water District well that is 1,700 feet
downgradient of the site. The district serves 20,000 people. Another 32,000 people are served by West
Hempstead-Hempstead Gardens Water District wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
