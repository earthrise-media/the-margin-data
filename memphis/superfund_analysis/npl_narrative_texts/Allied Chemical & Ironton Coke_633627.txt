NPL Site Narrative for Allied Chemical &
Ironton Coke
 
ALLIED CHEMICAL & IRONTON COKE
Ironton, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Allied Chemical & Iron Coke Site covers 40 acres in Ironton,
Lawrence County, Ohio. It involves two adjacent industrial facilities that use lagoons to hold hazardous
wastes on their properties. Hazardous wastes such as lime sludge and tar sludge located between the
two facilities are suspected of contaminating ground water. Studies detected ammonia, chloride, cyanides,
phenols, and thiocyanates in ground water, creating a potential for affecting local wells. There is also a
potential for contamination of the Ohio River and Ice Creek, which supply municipal drinking water.
 
Status (July 1983) : Ironton Coke is no longer using its lagoons.
 
EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
