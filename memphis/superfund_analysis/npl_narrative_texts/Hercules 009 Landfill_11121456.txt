NPL Site Narrative for Hercules 009
Landfill
 
HERCULES 009 LANDFILL
Brunswick, Georgia
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Hercules 009 Landfill covers 16.5 acres several miles north
of Brunswick, Georgia. Hercules, Inc., has used 7 acres for disposal of waste water treatment sludge
containing toxaphene, a pesticide, from its Brunswick plant. From 1975 to 1980, the landfill operated
under a State permit. The permit was revoked in July 1980 when the State discovered elevated levels of
toxaphene in drainage ditches around the site. Hercules reports disposing of 19,300 tons of contaminated
sludge at the site.
 
The landfill is in a marshland and is about 1 mile east of coastal wetlands. The site is underlain by several
feet of peat and marshland deposits over a shallow sand aquifer. The nearest residential area is 500 feet
away. Residential wells in the area generally tap the shallow aquifer, while municipal and industrial wells
usually tap the deeper limestone Principal Artesian Aquifer. The two aquifers are separated by a 500-
to-600-foot-thick confining layer; consequently, only the shallow aquifer is threatened at this time.
 
Status (June 1984) : In October 1983, Hercules installed six monitoring wells around the site in accordance
with a State plan for closing the landfill. Since that time, the company has sampled the wells several times
and submitted a full geotechnical report and proposed closure plan to the State. The geotechnical data are
currently under review to determine adequacy of the closure plan.
