NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY (LOT 86,FARM UNIT #1)
Raleigh, North Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : A 1.5-acre site to the north of Carter-Finley Stadium in
Raleigh, Wade County, North Carolina, referred to as Lot 86, Farm Unit #1, was used by the science
laboratories and agricultual research facilities of North Carolina State University as a waste disposal area.
From 1969 to 1980, solvents, pesticides, heavy metals, acids, and bases were buried in containers in 10-
foot trenches. The site is completely fenced.
 
The University's Department of Marine, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences has extensively monitored the
site since 1981. One background and three downgradient wells were drilled to a depth of about 10 feet
below the water table. Analyses of ground water indicate the presence of high levels (in the parts-per-
million range) of chloroform, bromoform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and methylene chloride.
 
An estimated 3,900 people in surrounding communities use private wells and have no other source of
drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
