NPL Site Narrative for Ionia City Landfill
 
IONIA CITY LANDFILL
Ionia, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Ionia City Landfill occupies 10 acres 0.8 mile east of
the City of Ionia, Ionia County, Michigan. From the 1950s to 1968, the city owned and operated the
site for disposal of municipal wastes. A portion of the site later became a recreational area. A citizen's
complaint in February 1981 led to discovery of drums at the site, both buried and on the surface. Some
were on the floodplain of the Grand River. In June 1981, the State excavated about 100 drums, many
containing industrial liquids and some leaking. The city placed snow fences around the excavated drums.
Sampling showed that the drums contain organic solvents and heavy metals. In July 1981, the State
placed monitoring wells around the site and found organics and heavy metals in ground water. Ionia's well
field lies about 1 mile northwest of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
