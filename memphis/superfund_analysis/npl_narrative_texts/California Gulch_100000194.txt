NPL Site Narrative for California Gulch
 
CALIFORNIA GULCH
Leadville, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : California Gulch flows about 1.5 miles to its confluence with
the Arkansas River in Colorado's Leadville Mining District. It has been seriously impacted by lead, silver,
zinc, copper, and gold mining activities. Numerous abandoned mines and tailing piles are located in the
gulch. The most serious water quality problem is acid mine drainage from the Yak Tunnel, a 3.4-mile tunnel
constructed from 1895 to 1909 for the purpose of exploration, transportation of ore, and mine drainage.
The tunnel is connected to 17 mines. The flow from the tunnel contains high concentrations of dissolved
metals, including iron, lead, zinc, manganese, and cadmium.
 
California Gulch drains to the Arkansas River. There is concern about the potential for (1) contamination of
domestic ground water supplies in the California Gulch area, (2) adverse impacts on fish in the Arkansas
River, and (3) adverse impacts on livestock and crops grown on agricultural land irrigated by the Arkansas
River.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation to define the contamination problem the
Yak Tunnel and tailings piles pose to ground water and surface water and a feasibility study to evaluate
and select a remedy to correct the problem. The work is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter
of 1984.
