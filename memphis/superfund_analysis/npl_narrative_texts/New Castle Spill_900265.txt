NPL Site Narrative for New Castle Spill
 
NEW CASTLE SPILL
New Castle County, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The New Castle Spill Site in New Castle County, Delaware,
is situated in an industrial and commercial location. The shallow aquifer has been sampled and several
compounds have been found, including TRIS [tris (beta-chloropropyl) phosphate] and other organic
substances. It is known that some of these chemicals were stored at a nearby industrial facility, but other
chemicals, source unknown, were also found in ground water. The shallow aquifer that had been used by
the New Castle Board of Water and Light was taken out of service, and 7,000 people are now supplied
water from another source.
 
This site was once listed under the name "Tris Spill."
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is presently reviewing the toxicity of TRIS to determine the health hazard.
