NPL Site Narrative for Midland Products
 
MIDLAND PRODUCTS
Birta, Ola, Arkansas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Midland Products formerly treated wood on a 4-acre site on
Highway 10 in Yell County between the towns of Ola and Birta, Arkansas. The site is just south of the Petit
Jean Wildlife Management Area and Keeland Creek in the Ouachita Mountains.
 
Midland Products, now bankrupt, operated the site from 1969 to 1979. The company stored
pentachlorophenol and creosote for the wood-treatment process in surface impoundments and above-
ground storage tanks. In 1982, EPA detected these chemicals and PCBs in the surface impoundments. A
shallow aquifer is also contaminated. Approximately 190 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a
source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State is planning a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. Field activities are expected to begin in the fall of 1986.
