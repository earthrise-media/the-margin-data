NPL Site Narrative for SCRDI Bluff Road
 
SCRDI BLUFF ROAD
Columbia, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The South Carolina Recycling and Disposal, Inc. (SCRDI) Bluff
Road Site is on State Highway 48 (Bluff Road) about 7 miles southeast of downtown Columbia, South
Carolina. The property covers about 7 acres, of which 2 acres are actually used for waste storage. About
7,200 drums of toxic, flammable, and reactive wastes are on-site, as well as numerous smaller containers.
Two small ponds at the northern end of the site are remnants of lime slurry disposal ponds used by an
acetylene manufacturer that once occupied the property. The storage area is partially fenced. Air, ground
water, and surface water are contaminated.
 
This is the top priority site in South Carolina.
 
Status (July 1983) : During early 1982, a group of generators contracted with one of the generators, TRI,
Inc., to clean up 75 percent of the surface of the site at a cost of $1.6 million. The cleanup was completed
in late 1982. In June 1982, EPA awarded a $1,078,292 Cooperative Agreement to South Carolina to clean
up the remaining surface waste and conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study for cleanup of
ground water. In August 1982, EPA approved $100,000 for remedial design activities. The surface cleanup
is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983, and the feasibility study in the third quarter of
1984.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, has brought a Federal civil action against those generators
who failed to participate in the surface cleanup by TRI.
