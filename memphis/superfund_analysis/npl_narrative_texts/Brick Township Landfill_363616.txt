NPL Site Narrative for Brick Township
Landfill
 
BRICK TOWNSHIP LANDFILL
Brick Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Brick Township Landfill (Old French's Landfill) covers 50 acres in
a residential area of Brick, Ocean County, New Jersey. Prior to 1972, the landfill was privately owned and
received up to 120,000 gallons of waste, including chemical wastes, per day. Brick Township acquired the
site in 1972. Remaining on the site are five liquid-filled lagoons, about 180 empty drums, and an old waste
incinerator. Four on-site monitoring wells indicate high concentrations of organic solvents. The source of
drinking water for 57,500 area residents is the underlying Cohansey Aquifer. The site is 50 feet from a
group of condominiums and across the street from the proposed site for a school.
 
Status (July 1983) : A landfill closure plan is being developed by the township. However, further
investigation is necessary to determine the need for and extent of additional remedial action.
