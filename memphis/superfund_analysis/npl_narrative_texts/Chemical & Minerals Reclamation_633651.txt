NPL Site Narrative for Chemical &
Minerals Reclamation
 
CHEMICAL & MINERALS RECLAMATION
Cleveland, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 23, 1981) : Chemicals & Minerals Reclamation is an inactive
reclamation, recycling, and storage facility located along the banks of the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland,
Ohio. EPA started litigation against the owners in 1979, resulting in a temporary restraining order and a
final court order that gave EPA authorization to remove the hazardous wastes and charge the costs to
the owners. Cleanup progressed until July 2, 1980, when a fire forced the facility to close. Afterwards, six
3,500-gallon vats and 2,000 drums containing chlorinated and nonchlorinated solvents, acids, and sludges
remained on the site. On February 27, 1981, a Section 311 violation of the Clean Water Act was declared
at the site because of the possibility for contamination of the navigable river. After the declaration, several
hundred drums and the total contents of the vats were removed under Section 311. The remainder of the
drums will be removed and site structures demolished.
 
Status (December 30, 1982) : This site was on the Interim Priorities List, announced October 23, 1981
before formal rulemaking began in the Federal Register. This site is being deleted from the NPL because
EPA, in consultation with the State of Ohio, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed
response under CERCLA has been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is
appropriate.
