NPL Site Narrative for Beckman
Instruments (Porterville Plant)
 
BECKMAN INSTRUMENTS (PORTERVILLE PLANT)
Porterville, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Beckman Instruments manufactures electronic equipment
on a site near Porterville, a small rural community in Tulare County, California. A number of solvents and
electroplating chemicals are used in the facility's operations.
 
A solar evaporation pond is part of the facility's waste water treatment system. The pond's liner developed
a leak, allowing waste water containing heavy metals and volatile organic compounds to enter the soil. The
liner and contaminated soil were removed from the site. Organic chemicals similar to those disposed of in
the pond have been found in the upper aquifer underlying the area. Beckman has provided bottled water
to the 750 residents whose wells are contaminated. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board
is working with Beckman to develop a comprehensive monitoring system to determine the full extent of
ground water contamination.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Beckman has installed and is operating a ground water extraction and treatment
system to control the plume of contamination. The company will also conduct a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the need for additional remedial measures.
 
Residents previously using bottled water have been provided with a municipal drinking water supply.
