NPL Site Narrative for Syosset Landfill
 
SYOSSET LANDFILL
Oyster Bay, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Syosset Landfill is in Oyster Bay, New York. The town
suspended operations at the landfill in January 1975 after Nassau County detected water pollution.
Investigations revealed high concentrations of heavy metals in the industrial sludges being deposited, as
well as in wastes discharged from the scavenger plant operations. In addition, volatile organic compounds
in two private wells and one Jericho Water District well are substantially above safe drinking levels. The
site is located in the county's primary ground water recharge area. A school is nearby.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
