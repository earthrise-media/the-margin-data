NPL Site Narrative for Saegertown
Industrial Area
 
SAEGERTOWN INDUSTRIAL AREA
Saegertown, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Saegertown Industrial Area covers approximately 100
acres in the Borough of Saegertown, Crawford County, Pennsylvania. Tests conducted in April 1980 by the
Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PA DER) found that Saegertown Municipal Water
Authority's Well No. 2 was contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. The well
was taken out of service in June 1980 and returned to service in March 1984.
 
To date, several potential sources of the contamination have been identified. GATX operated a plant for
cleaning and repairing railroad tank cars on the site from the mid-1950s to 1965. The company used a
pond for disposal of materials left in the cars and sludge from a water treatment plant. Tests conducted
by EPA in July 1984 detected TCE, tetrachloroethylene, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, and 1,4-
dichlorobenzene in pond sediments and on GATX property.
 
Since 1964, Saegertown Manufacturing Co. has manufactured small steel components in the area. In
1981, PA DER detected lead and TCE breakdown products in the company's septic tank, and TCE in wells
on the company's property.
 
Spectrum Control, Inc., has manufactured ceramic capacitors in the Saegertown Industrial Area since
1969. The company used TCE and 1,1,1-TCA to clean the capacitors, according to information the
company provided to the Borough of Saegertown. PA DER has detected 1,1,1-TCA in wells on the
company's property.
 
Lord Corp. has provided adhesives, urethane coatings, and "rubber chemicals" on the site since 1962.
TCE, 1,1,1-TCA, xylene, and methyl isobutyl ketone (MIK) are used in the manufacturing process. In
1980, PA DER sampling detected TCE, 1,1,1-TCA, xylene, and MIK in cooling waters contained in on-site
unlined lagoons.
 
Other potential sources have been identified and are currently being evaluated.
 
Approximately 1,200 people draw drinking water from municipal wells and a private well within 3 miles of
the Saegertown Industrial Area. No other water source is available.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : PA DER is investigating the possibility that parties potentially responsible for
wastes associated with the site will conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
