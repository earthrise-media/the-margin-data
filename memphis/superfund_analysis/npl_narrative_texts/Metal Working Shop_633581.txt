NPL Site Narrative for Metal Working Shop
 
METAL WORKING SHOP
Lake Ann, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : The Metal Working Shop Site covers approximately 1 acre
in Lake Ann, Benzie County, Michigan. From 1974 to 1977, the owner of the property finished metals in
the shop using iron phosphate. Two types of rinse waters were generated in an oxidizing phase of the
operation: an acidic rinse (dilute hydrochloric acid) containing iron phosphate and a caustic rinse (sodium
hydroxide). From approximately October 1975 to February 1977, effluents from these rinses were mixed
to neutralize them and then dumped onto the ground. According to the owner, 400 gallons per day were
disposed of for 8 to 10 days a month.
 
Analyses by the State detected chromium, molybdenum, and other heavy metal salts in the rinses. Ground
water occurs at shallow depths (10 feet), and wells draw from the very permeable sand and gravel drift
aquifer. Hence, the wells are threatened by any heavy metals in site soil. An estimated 1,100 people obtain
drinking water from private wells into the aquifer within 3 miles of the site. One well is on the site.
 
The site is on a hill between Lake View and Lake Ann. Many other lakes are within 3 miles of the site.
 
In June 1983, a new owner took over the site and operates it under the name Lake Ann Manufacturing, Inc.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
