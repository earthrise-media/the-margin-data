NPL Site Narrative for Delaware City PVC
Plant
 
DELAWARE CITY PVC PLANT
Delaware City, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Stauffer Chemical Co. operated a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant
in Delaware City, New Castle County, Delaware, from the early 1970s to 1981. The facility, which covers
180 acres, disposed of various wastes in several unlined impoundments and pits. Portions of the plant
were sold to Formosa Plastics in May 1981. Ground water in the area is contaminated with hazardous
substances associated with the PVC plant, and this problem may have existed for years.
 
This site was first listed under the name "Stauffer Chemical Co."
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1982, Stauffer started a detailed hydrogeological investigation at the site,
which included drilling several shallow monitoring wells and performing a resistivity survey. The company
presented the results to EPA in February 1983, along with a proposal for detailed feasibility study. A
cleanup order is currently being negotiated. In addition, Stauffer has provided alternate water supplies for
residents whose water is contaminated.
