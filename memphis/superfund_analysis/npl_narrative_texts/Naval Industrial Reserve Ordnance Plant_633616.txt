NPL Site Narrative for Naval Industrial
Reserve Ordnance Plant
 
NAVAL INDUSTRIAL RESERVE ORDNANCE PLANT
Fridley, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (July 14, 1989) : The Naval Industrial Reserve Ordnance Plant (NIROP) covers
83 acres in an industrial, commercial, and residential area in Fridley, Anoka County, Minnesota. Over
200,000 people live within 3 miles of the site. The Mississippi River is 0.3 mile to the west. NIROP has
produced advanced weapons systems since it was constructed in 1940. FMC Corp., NIROP's operating
contractor, owns a 50-acre site bordering on the south. It was placed on the NPL in September 1983 under
the name FMC Corp. (Fridley Plant).
 
Industrial operations at NIROP generate organic-solvent and heavy-metal wastes. According to the Naval
Facilities Engineering Command, 43 drums of such wastes were buried at the landfill from the early 1950s
to the early 1970s. Analyses conducted by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) found that
soil and ground water on the site are contaminated with solvents, including acetone, dichloroethylene,
trichloroethylene (TCE), and methylene chloride. In 1981, three bedrock wells supplying drinking water
to NIROP were taken out of service because of TCE contamination. Tests conducted by MPCA in 1982
on Fridley municipal well #13 did not detect TCE. An estimated 29,000 people obtain drinking water from
public wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
During 1983-84, the Army Corps of Engineers excavated 43 drums and 1,200 cubic yards of soil and
transported the materials to EPA-regulated hazardous waste landfills. The actions were conducted as part
of the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), established in 1978. Under this program, the Department of
Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination from hazardous materials.
 
On June 26, 1984, MPCA issued a Request for Response Action calling for the Navy and FMC to
determine the extent of surface water and ground water contamination, locate any additional disposal
areas, and take cleanup action. In response, a network of monitoring wells was installed to gather
information on patterns of ground water flow and contaminant concentrations. In July-August 1988, a
remedial investigation/feasibility study was completed. EPA has not yet concurred on the report.
 
An interim remedial measure is being designed involving pumping of ground water to the surface and
treating it to remove the contaminants.
 
As of June 1989, NIROP has held three Technical Review Committee meetings with EPA, MPCA, and
local representatives, as well as one public meeting.
 
Status (November 21, 1989) : The Navy is developing an Interagency Agreement under CERCLA Section
120 covering activities at NIROP.
