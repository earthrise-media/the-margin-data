DONNELSVILLE CONTAMI NATED Donnelsville, Ohio 
Clark County AQUIFER 
Site Location: The Donnelsville Contaminated Aquifer (DCA) site is a contaminated groundwater plume originating from an unknown source or sources located in the village of Donnelsville and portions of Bethel Township, Ohio. 
•Site History:Tetrachloroethylene (PCE) contamination in the Donnelsville area was first detected in 1990 during compliance sampling at the Donnelsville Elementary School. Following closure of the school wells, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) referred the site to the EPA for assessment activities in 2010 due to Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) contamination of local groundwater and the presence of nearby potable wells which draw from the same aquifer. A manufacturer of truck, airplane, baby swings, car seats, and high chair parts formerly operating on North Hampton Road is a potential source of PCE contamination but has denied the use of VOCs and no specific source or sources could be confirmed in the vicinity of the plume to which the groundwater contamination could reasonably be attributed. 
•Site Contamination/Contaminants:Groundwater has been contaminated by VOCs, including PCE, trichloroethylene (TCE), and cis -1,2-dichloroethene (DCE). 
•Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : Groundwater contamination has migrated to local drinking water wells. Approximately 25 air strippers or granulated activated carbon (GAC) water treatment systems have been installed at residences with drinking water well samples containing PCE above the Safe Drinking Water Act’s Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). 
•Response Activities (to date): Over the last several years, the EPA has coordinated with the OEPA to investigate and respond to the contamination at the site. In 2011, the EPA's Removal Program installed treatment systems in homes and a community park well where the levels of contaminants exceeded MCLs. Additional residential properties sampled in 2014 and 2016 were found to have PCE at concentrations greater than the MCL. For those properties, the former manufacturing facility has offered to pay for installation of water treatment systems, to replace previously installed water treatment systems which were no longer effectively operating, and to provide bottled water to residents until the treatment systems were installed. 
•Need for NPL Listing:
The state of Ohio referred the site to EPA due to the VOC groundwater plume and potential for contaminated 
drinking water wells. Other feder al and state cleanup programs were evaluated, bu t are not viable at this time.  The EPA 
received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from the  state.  þ
