NPL Site Narrative for Davis (GSR) Landfill
 
DAVIS (GSR) LANDFILL
Glocester, Rhode Island
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : The Davis Glocester Sanitary Regional (GSR) Landfill covers 58
acres in the town of Glocester, Providence County, Rhode Island. It is across the town line and across the
street from the Davis Liquid Waste Site in Smithfield, which was placed on the NPL in September 1983.
 
Between 1974 and 1976, the landfill, which was privately owned and permitted by the State to accept
municipal wastes, accepted such wastes from Glocester, Smithfield, Warwick, and Providence. In January
1978, the State did not renew the permit. Following numerous legal actions to close the site, the State
Supreme Court ruled in favor of the State in April 1982. The site was then officially closed, although it has
not been properly capped or stabilized.
 
Among the contaminants detected at the site are toluene, chloroform, benzene, 1,1-dichloroethane, and
1,1,1-trichloroethane. The State found contamination of both surface water and ground water on-site. EPA
confirmed off-site contamination. According to the State, contaminated ground water is moving toward
Waterman Reservoir, which is used for recreational activities. About 3,800 people use private wells within 3
miles of the site for drinking water. No municipal supplies are readily available.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives at the site.
