NPL Site Narrative for Shieldalloy Corp.
 
SHIELDALLOY CORP.
Newfield Borough, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Shieldalloy Corp. manufactures specialty alloys, particularly
chromium, on 61.6 acres in Newfield Borough, Gloucester County, New Jersey. The plant now treats its
process waste water before discharging it. In the past, however, the plant released the water directly to
an unlined lagoon and to surface water. Analyses conducted by the State detected extensive hexavalent
chromium contamination in ground water and surface water. The area is totally dependent upon ground
water for drinking supplies.
 
The State has issued numerous directives to the company since 1970. In 1972, the State condemned
Newfield Borough Well #2A due to chromium contamination. The company is under a State directive to
prepare a detailed proposal for decontaminating ground water.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
