NPL Site Narrative for Smith's Farm
 
SMITH'S FARM
Brooks, Kentucky
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Smith's Farm is located approximately 1.5 miles southwest
of Brooks, Bullitt County, Kentucky. The entire farm is about 500 acres and includes a 37.5-acre landfill
permitted by the State to accept nonhazardous wastes. On the farm property and adjacent to the permitted
landfill is an abandoned 30-acre dump containing an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 drums, many of which
are buried or partially buried.
 
EPA and the State have observed numerous leachate streams at the site, most of which drain into an
unnamed tributary to Bluelick Creek. Private residences located immediately downstream of the site use
water from Bluelick Creek for drinking and other purposes. Some of the nearby residents also use well
water. There is no alternate source of water. About 300 people are potentially affected.
 
Analyses conducted by EPA have detected elevated concentrations of phenols, PCBs, metals (mercury,
nickel, lead, chromium, copper, and cadmium), and other organic chemicals in leachate, soil, sediment,
and surface water.
 
In August 1984, using CERCLA emergency funds, EPA completed removal of 2,000 drums of waste from
the surface of the dump.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The next step in site cleanup is a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
