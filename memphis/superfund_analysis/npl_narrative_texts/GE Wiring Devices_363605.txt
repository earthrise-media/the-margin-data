NPL Site Narrative for GE Wiring Devices
 
GE WIRING DEVICES
Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The General Electric Co. Wiring Devices Site in Juana Diaz,
Puerto Rico, is a 5-acre facility that formerly manufactured mercury light switches. On the property is a 0.5-
acre inactive open dump for off-specification products. It is possible for contaminants to erode from the
dump, which is uncovered, onto a farm. The site, located in a residential area, is fenced. A small amount
of debris from the dump is just outside the fence. A public water supply well is located within 1,200 feet
of the site. EPA has not detected mercury in the air or well. Testing by the company for the Puerto Rico
Environmental Quality Board (EQB) has found mercury in the open dump.
 
Status (July 1983) : The company plans to clean up the site. It has hired a consultant to determine the
extent of ground water and soil contamination and to present evidence that a continuous clay layer
underlies the open dump. EPA is working with EQB and the company in efforts to clean up the site.
