NPL Site Narrative for Leetown Pesticide
 
LEETOWN PESTICIDE
Leetown, West Virginia
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Leetown Pesticide Site in Leetown, Jefferson County, West
Virginia, may be a case of midnight dumping. A pile containing about 1,200 cubic yards of material is
contaminated with several pesticides. Contamination of ground water, the only source of drinking water
for the area, is the major concern. Possible contamination of Bells Spring, which supplies the Federal Fish
Hatchery and National Fish Research Laboratory, is also of concern.
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1983, the contaminated pile was removed and properly disposed of by a
potentially responsible party. The removal was conducted under the supervision of the State and EPA.
Further testing is underway to check for possible residual contamination.
