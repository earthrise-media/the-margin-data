NPL Site Narrative for Midwest
Manufacturing/North Farm
 
MIDWEST MANUFACTURING/NORTH FARM
Kellogg, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Midwest Manufacturing/North Farm Site is in Jasper
County near Kellogg, Iowa. Midwest has operated a manufacturing facility that includes an electroplating
plant on the site since 1896. The plant occupies about 8 acres in South Kellogg in the floodplain of the
North Fork Skunk River. The plant's operation primarily involves cadmium, zinc, and nickel. The North
Farm portion of the site, 2.3 miles northeast of the plant, covers less than 1 acre. Both areas contain
unlined trenches used for the disposal of an estimated 1,200 cubic yards of the plant's electroplating
sludges. Because the two areas contain the same wastes and affect the same target population, they are
considered one NPL site.
 
The City of Kellogg draws water from shallow wells downstream on the banks of the North Fork Skunk
River. EPA detected zinc and copper in one city well within 500 feet of the Midwest Manufacturing plant.
EPA also found that soils adjacent to the North Farm trench contain significant levels of cadmium.
 
About 700 people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water. The site is
located within a possible critical habitat of the Indiana bat, designated an endangered species by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. Nearby surface waters are used for fishing.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
