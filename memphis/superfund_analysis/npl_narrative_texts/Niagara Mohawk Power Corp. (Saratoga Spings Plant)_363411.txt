NPL Site Narrative for Niagara Mohawk
Power Corp. (Saratoga Springs Plant)
 
NIAGARA MOHAWK POWER CORP. (SARATOGA SPRINGS
PLANT)
Saratoga Springs, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. plant covers approximately 7
acres within the City of Saratoga Springs, Saratoga County, New York. The area is zoned for industrial use
but is primarily residential. Currently, the site serves as a substation and regional operations facility. From
approximately 1853 to the 1940s, Niagara Mohawk's predecessors, Saratoga Gas and Light and New York
Power and Light Corp., produced a commercial fuel substitute from coal. The main waste associated with
coal gasification is coal tar, which contains polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. The company disposed of
coal tar by landfilling it on-site with other wastes.
 
In January 1986, a consultant to the company detected benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene,
phenanthrene, and other coal tar constituents in on-site soil and wells. An estimated 1,250 people in trailer
parks and other residences obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
A fresh water wetland is 0.2 mile from the site.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : On September 27, 1989, EPA and Niagara Mohawk signed an Administrative
Order on Consent for the company to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. EPA
is reviewing Niagara Mohawk's workplan for the RI/FS.
