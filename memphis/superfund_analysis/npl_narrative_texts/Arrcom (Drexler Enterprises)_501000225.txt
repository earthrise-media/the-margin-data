NPL Site Narrative for Arrcom (Drexler
Enterprises)
 
ARRCOM (DREXLER ENTERPRISES)
Rathdrum, Idaho
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Arrcom Corp. (Drexler Enterprises) Site covers 1.2 acres
about 2.8 miles southwest of Rathdrum, Idaho. For several years, Arrcom recycled waste oils containing
solvents, prior to abandoning the site in January 1982. Remaining on-site are 17 partially filled storage
tanks, the largest capacity being 45,000 gallons. The contents of most of the tanks have not yet been
determined. Chloroform has been found in a soil sample. Wastes processed at the site may have included
PCBs. The site sits directly over the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, which is the sole source of
drinking water for 350,000 people in the region.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA has collected soil samples to document leakage on site. In addition, EPA sent a
team to the site early in June 1983 to sample all tanks, as well as soil and drinking water from surrounding
properties. The general condition of the site was also assessed. Subsequent actions will depend largely on
the sampling results.
