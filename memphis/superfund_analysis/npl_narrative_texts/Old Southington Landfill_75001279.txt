NPL Site Narrative for Old Southington
Landfill
 
OLD SOUTHINGTON LANDFILL
Southington, Connecticut
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Old Southington Landfill covers 6 acres in Southington,
Connecticut. It is suspected of contaminating the town's Production Well Number 5, which is 500 to 600
feet away and about 3,500 feet east of the Quinnipiac River. The landfill, which the town operated from
1947 to 1967 as a municipal landfill, also accepted hazardous waste. An industrial park and several
homes have been built on top of the old landfill. Well Number 5 contains significant concentrations of
volatile organic compounds, particularly 1,1,1-trichloroethane, according to analyses done by the State.
Volatile organics are also present in nearby surface waters. A hydrogeologic investigation conducted by
EPA suggests that the abandoned landfill is a source of volatile organics entering area ground water. An
intensive hydrogeologic study is needed to determine flow patterns of local ground water, which will help
further define the source(s) of contamination.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State has discussed with the town issuance of an order requiring the town to
hire a contractor to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study. The work would include the intensive
hydrogeologic study. The town is presently soliciting proposals for the study.
