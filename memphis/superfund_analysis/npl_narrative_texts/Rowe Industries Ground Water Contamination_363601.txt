NPL Site Narrative for Rowe Industries
Ground Water Contamination
 
ROWE INDUSTRIES GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Noyack, Sag Harbor, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : Ground water contaminated with various chlorine-containing
organic chemicals has affected approximately 15 homes and is threatening 13 others with individual wells
in the Noyack/Sag Harbor area of Long Island, Suffolk County, New York. Within 3 miles of the site are
about 3,500 residents served by private wells and 2,500 people served by two Suffolk County Water
Authority wells.
 
Tests conducted by the Suffolk County Department of Health (SCDH) indicate that a plume of
contaminated ground water is about 500 feet wide and 2,600 feet long. To date, contamination has
been verified from 12 feet below the surface to depths greater than 124 feet, with high concentrations of
contaminants occurring at between 40 and 82 feet. A preliminary investigation by SCDH implicates Rowe
Industries, which formerly occupied the site now occupied by Sag Harbor Industries, as the source of
contamination. The site investigation is continuing.
 
When SCDH detected the contamination in private wells, it advised the affected residents not to drink the
water, not to use it for cooking, and to limit its use for bathing to short tepid showers. A local fire station
provided drinking water. In early 1985, EPA used CERCLA emergency removal funds to extend public
water supply mains to 25 homes.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
