NPL Site Narrative for Hocomonco Pond
 
HOCOMONCO POND
Westborough, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Hocomonco was a recreational pond in Westborough,
Massachusetts, until the State closed it in 1980. It is privately owned. From 1920 to 1963, the site was the
location of wood-treating and asphalt-batching operations. Past disposal practices resulted in creosote
and phenol contamination of ground water, surface water, and sediments and soils in the pond and on its
shore. A municipal well, the Otis Street Well, is located 1,500 feet to the northwest of the pond. To date, no
contaminants have been detected in this well, which is sampled every 6 months.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site.
 
The owners of the property contracted for a study of the historical use of the land and the processing
operations and disposal practices associated with each use. The contractor also recommended an
approach to investigation of the area.
