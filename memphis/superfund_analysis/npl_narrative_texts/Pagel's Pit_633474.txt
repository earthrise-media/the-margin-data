NPL Site Narrative for Pagel's Pit
 
PAGEL'S PIT
Rockford, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Pagel's Pit in Rockford, Winnebago County, Illinois, is a
former sand and gravel pit and dolomite quarry that has been operated by Winnebago Reclamation as a
landfill since July 17, 1972. The pit covers approximately 60 acres and is lined with "blacktop," which has a
coal tar sealer.
 
Records indicate that the site accepted a variety of wastes, including organics, solvents, and heavy metals,
as well as mixed municipal refuse and sewage treatment sludge. About 120,000 gallons of liquid wastes, in
addition to solid refuse, have been deposited on-site.
 
A shallow, fractured bedrock aquifer near the site is a source of drinking water for residents in the area.
It is contaminated with several volatile organic compounds and arsenic, according to tests conducted by
the Winnebago County Health Department, the State, and EPA. In 1981, the State Health Department
tested drinking water supplies in response to complaints from residents. The results indicated high levels
(517 parts per billion) of volatile organic compounds. The contamination forced several homeowners near
Pagel's Pit to use bottled water supplied by Winnebago Reclamation.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is negotiating for a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) with parties
potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site. The RI/FS would determine the type and extent
of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
