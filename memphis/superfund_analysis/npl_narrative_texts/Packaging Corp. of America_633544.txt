PACKAGING CORP. OF AMERICA
Filer City, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Packaging Corp. of America (PCA) operates a Kraft paper mill on
a 2-acre site in Filer City, Manistee County, Michigan. From the 1950s until 1974, PCA dumped untreated
pulp mill black liquor and other process wastes in a series of unlined lagoons in Stronach Township, about
1 mile northeast of Filer City. In 1976, the Village of East Lake, to the northwest of the site, abandoned
a municipal well because of contamination caused by the lagoons. In 1978, PCA placed nine monitoring
wells around the site. EPA sampling in August 1981 detected high levels of heavy metals and arsenic
in the ground water. Ground water in the region flows toward Manistee Lake, an important recreational
resource.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through an enforcement action
against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
