NPL Site Narrative for Jibboom Junkyard
 
JIBBOOM JUNKYARD
Sacramento, California
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Jibboom Junkyard covers 9 acres in Sacramento, California,
on the floodplain of the Sacramento River. A metal-salvaging business operated on the site. Among other
things, the company dismantled transformers and possibly asbestos-lined boilers. The original size of
the site is unknown, but it may once have covered about 35 acres. Portions of the original site are now
occupied by motels and/or are a part of Interstate Freeway I-5.
 
Soil sampling by the State in 1981 detected levels of heavy metals exceeding the State's Total Threshold
Limit Concentrations. There were also indications of PCB contamination. The soil is highly permeable, and
the aquifer is 35 feet below the surface. The city's drinking water is taken from the river at the northwest
corner of the site. The river is also used for recreation and irrigation.
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1983, EPA collected soil samples, and in May 1983 the State fenced the site
to limit public access. In June 1983, deep core samples were collected to further determine the extent and
nature of contamination on the site.
