NPL Site Narrative for Culpeper Wood
Preservers, Inc.
 
CULPEPER WOOD PRESERVERS, INC.
Culpeper, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Since 1976, Culpeper Wood Preservers, Inc., has treated
wood with a chromated copper arsenate solution on a 20-acre site in the outskirts of Culpeper, Culpeper
County, Virginia. In February 1981, approximately 100,000 gallons of waste containing significant levels
of arsenic and chromium spilled from an impoundment, contaminating neighboring surface waters. In
February 1981, EPA issued an Administrative Complaint against Culpeper Wood Preservers under Subtitle
C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In September 1981, the site owner agreed
to issuance of a Consent Agreement and Consent Order under RCRA Section 3008(a), which required
certain remedial actions.
 
Ground water under the site is contaminated with arsenic and chromium, according to analyses conducted
by the State. About 2,000 people depend on the contaminated aquifer within 3 miles of the site for drinking
water.
 
Status (January 1986) : In March 1985, EPA completed a search for parties potentially responsible for
wastes associated with the site. In April 1985, EPA issued a general notice letter informing Jefferson
Homebuilders, Inc., of its potential liability at the site.
 
EPA assessed the need for removal action at the site in July 1985 and concluded that a removal was not
warranted at that time.
 
Status (June 24, 1988) : EPA is proposing to place this previously proposed RCRA site on the NPL. The
September 1981 Consent Order and Consent Agreement under RCRA Section 3008(a) stated that the
facility would be exempt from future RCRA regulation once the specified remedial actions were taken. The
company took the specified actions, and so is not regulated under RCRA authorities. If the facility agrees
to clean up the site according to Subtitle C corrective action requirements, EPA would consider removing it
from the NPL.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA has placed this site on the NPL.
 
EPA continues to search for potentially responsible parties and in 1990 plans to investigate the possibility
that those identified will conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent
of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
