NPL Site Narrative for Lauer I Sanitary
Landfill
 
LAUER I SANITARY LANDFILL
Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Lauer I Sanitary Landfill covers 56 acres in Menomonee
Falls, Waukesha County, Wisconsin. From the mid-1950s to 1972, the privately owned landfill accepted a
variety of municipal and industrial wastes. Ground water beneath the site is shallow.
 
In 1973-74, State inspections revealed holes in the berm around the site, allowing leachate from a
collection pond to escape into a drainage ditch that drains into the Menomonee River. In 1974, the State
issued an order for the owner to close the site properly. In 1981, the owner installed an underground
wall of clay materials between the landfill and the pond to stem the flow of leachate. Presently, leachate
accumulating behind the cutoff wall is going to a municipal waste water treatment plant. Although the
landfill has been covered and seeded for recreational use, leachate continues to threaten ground water
and nearby surface waters, according to samples collected by the company and inspections by the State.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State continues to work with the site owner to provide for complete and proper
closure of the site and resolution of the problem.
