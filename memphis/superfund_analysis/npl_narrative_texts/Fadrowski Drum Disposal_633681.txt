FADROWSKI DRUM DISPOSAL
Franklin, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Fadrowski Drum Disposal Site covers 40 acres in
Franklin, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin. From 1970 through 1981, Ed's Masonry and Trucking was
licensed by the State to operate a transportation and collection service on the site.
 
Early in 1983, Menard, Inc., purchased a portion of the site and began construction of a home building
materials store. Excavation turned up buried drums. The contents were analyzed by the State and found to
be hazardous as defined by the State. Little is known about the amounts or types of wastes disposed at the
site, which was not authorized to accept hazardous wastes.
 
The area is semirural; nearby communities are expanding their residential development. About 18,000
people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water. The soils consist of
sediments and clays. A creek flows through the western edge of the property.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
