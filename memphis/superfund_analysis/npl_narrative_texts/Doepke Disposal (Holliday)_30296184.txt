NPL Site Narrative for Doepke Disposal
(Holliday)
 
DOEPKE DISPOSAL (HOLLIDAY)
Johnson County, Kansas
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Doepke Disposal (Holliday) operated a 10-acre site on the
southern bluffs of the Kansas River Valley in Johnson County, Kansas, during the 1960s. The site, at the
intersection of Holliday Drive and Interstate 435, received unknown quantities of industrial wastes such as
paint sludges, spent solvents, metal tailings, and fiberglass resins. Leachate containing toxic organic and
inorganic chemicals flows through a culvert under Holliday Drive into the Kansas River. County residents
receive drinking water primarily from 21 wells less than 1 mile downstream from the site. Additional
supplies are drawn from the Kansas River.
 
Status (July 1983) : Recent analyses detected iron, manganese, boron, other metals, and bis-2-
ethylhexylphthalate in leachate and shallow ground water. Contaminants in the leachate have not been
detected at the River intake or in the well field. EPA is now evaluating these recent data. In addition, EPA
is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full extent
of cleanup required at the site.
