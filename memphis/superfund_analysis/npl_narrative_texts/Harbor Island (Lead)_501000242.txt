NPL Site Narrative for Harbor Island
(Lead)
 
HARBOR ISLAND (LEAD)
Seattle, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Harbor Island (Lead) site covers about 350 acres and is an
industrial area in Seattle, Washington, at the mouth of the Duwamish Waterway where it empties into Elliott
Bay. Air monitoring has recorded lead at levels several times the national standard established to protect
human health. There is also concern that run-off has carried lead-laden dust and accumulations of lead in
the Harbor Island soil into nearby surface water and, by percolation, into ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : The City of Seattle has paved areas where concentrations of airborne lead are the
highest. In addition, one company that is a source of airborne lead has taken measures to reduce fugitive
lead-laden dust and emissions of lead from its process. The City is paving more areas and will then
evaluate if additional paving is still needed. More information is required to determine how much of the lead
problem on Harbor Island is caused by current emissions from one or more industrial sources and how
much by re-suspension of accumulated lead in soil.
 
EPA recently completed a draft Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
