NPL Site Narrative for Red Penn
Sanitation Co. Landfill
 
RED PENN SANITATION CO. LANDFILL
Peewee Valley, Kentucky
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Red Penn Sanitation Co., Inc., Landfill covers 150 acres 1.5
miles southeast of Peewee Valley, Kentucky, in the southern tip of Oldham County. The landfill operated
from 1952 to December 1986. Previously, the site had been an open dump. During 1970-86, the company
operated under a permit from the Kentucky Division of Waste Management (KDWM) to dispose of solid
waste on 40 acres.
 
In March 1986, KDWM found lead, chromium, xylene, and toluene in drums and soil on the site. According
to the State, at least 5,400 drums of hazardous waste generated by Anaconda (Anamag) in LaGrange,
Kentucky, were disposed of in the Red Penn Landfill during 1968-74. These drums, which contained waste
enamels, drawing solution from curing of copper wire, and scrap varnish, were buried along with sanitary
waste as part of the daily landfill operations. Also during this same period, according to the State, 7,800
drums of paint wastes generated by the Ford Motor Co. plant in Louisville were disposed of in the landfill.
 
In 1986, the State detected PCB (Aroclor 1254) and selenium in a drainage ditch on the site. The landfill
is bordered to the east and south by Floyd's Fork, a major stream. About 250 feet downstream from the
landfill is a public water intake that provides drinking water to an estimated 250 people at the Peewee
Valley Women's Reformatory. Ground water at the site is shallow (21 feet). Soils are highly permeable,
and there are numerous sinkholes in the site area. These conditions favor movement of contaminants into
ground water. An estimated 850 people obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
On May 22, 1986, KDWM filed a Request for Appropriate Action against Red Penn Sanitation and other
parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site. On July 22, 1986, KDWM filed another
action for immediate removal of on-site wastes. On August 8, 1986, a Notice of Violation was filed against
Red Penn Sanitation.
 
In September-October 1986, Red Penn Sanitation removed 207 tons of wastes and contaminated soil from
two locations on the landfill and transported them to a hazardous waste facility regulated under Subtitle
C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Random soil samples indicated a need to remove
additional soil. The State informed Red Penn Sanitation of the additional cleanup needed, but the company
refused to fund the additional cleanup. On April 9, 1987, KDWM sent letters to potentially responsible
parties requesting voluntary cooperation in future site activities.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA's preliminary plan for fiscal year 1989 includes a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action.
