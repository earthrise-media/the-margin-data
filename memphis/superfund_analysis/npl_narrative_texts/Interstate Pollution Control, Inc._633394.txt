NPL Site Narrative for Interstate Pollution
Control, Inc.
 
INTERSTATE POLLUTION CONTROL, INC.
Rockford, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Interstate Pollution Control, Inc., formerly operated a hazardous
waste storage facility on 1-2 acres in a heavily industrialized section of Rockford, Winnebago County,
Illinois. During 1974-82, the company, a division of Roto-Rooter Sewer Service, Inc., hauled and
sometimes stored waste oils, solvents, and cyanide-containing plating wastes from 20-25 local industries.
Currently, waste oils are reclaimed and sold.
 
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and EPA documents indicate a history of poor operating
practices, including unlined surface impoundments, leaking storage tanks, and leaking drums.
 
In 1979, Interstate Pollution Control removed drums and contaminated soil from the facility and transported
them to an EPA-regulated disposal facility.
 
In 1986, EPA detected 1,1-dichloroethylene, 1-1-dichloroethane, trans-1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-
trichloroethane, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene in off-site wells downgradient of the site. An
estimated 155,000 people obtain drinking water from City of Rockford wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Parts of the fence surrounding the site are broken, making it possible for people and animals to come into
direct contact with hazardous substances.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
