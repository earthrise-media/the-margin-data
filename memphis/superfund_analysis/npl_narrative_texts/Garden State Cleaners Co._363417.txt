NPL Site Narrative for Garden State
Cleaners Co.
 
GARDEN STATE CLEANERS CO.
Minotola, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Garden State Cleaners Co. Site is in a mixed residential,
commercial, and light industrial area in the Minotola section of Buena Borough, Atlantic County, New
Jersey. The surrounding area is predominantly rural and one of New Jersey's prime agricultural areas.
Since the 1950s, the company has operated on Summer Road approximately 500 feet from South Jersey
Clothing Co., which is also being proposed for the NPL at this time.
 
In an investigation of Garden State Cleaners in 1984, the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection detected 43,000 parts per billion (ppb) of tetrachloroethylene in soil below a steam discharge
pipe. Off-site monitoring wells downgradient of Garden State Cleaners and South Jersey Clothing contain
up to 78,000 ppb of trichloroethylene and 6,600 ppb of tetrachloroethylene, according to analyses
conducted in 1984 by the companies. These concentrations have forced closing of private wells and
construction of a new municipal water supply system. Approximately 9,000 people obtain drinking water
and 3,800 acres of farmland are irrigated from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1988) : EPA is preparing a workplan for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
