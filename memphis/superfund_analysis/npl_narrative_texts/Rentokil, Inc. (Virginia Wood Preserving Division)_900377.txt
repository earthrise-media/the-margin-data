NPL Site Narrative for Rentokil, Inc.
(Virginia Wood Preserving Division)
 
RENTOKIL, INC. (VIRGINIA WOOD PRESERVING DIVISION)
Richmond, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : Rentokil, Inc. (Virginia Wood Preserving Division) has
operated a wood-treatment facility on a 4-acre site in Richmond, Henrico County, Virginia, since 1965. The
area, on the outskirts of metropolitan Richmond, is developing rapidly. Until about 1981, the company used
creosote and pentachlorophenol as preservatives. In 1982, use of pentachlorophenol was discontinued,
and chromated copper arsenate came into use. Creosote continued in use.
 
EPA has detected high concentrations of chromated copper arsenate in an unlined surface impoundment
on the site. Rentokil has detected the same contaminant in run-off, soils, and a monitoring well on the site.
An estimated 350 people draw drinking water from private wells that tap the contaminated aquifer within 3
miles of the site. The nearest private well, which is within 1,300 feet of the site, is not contaminated to date.
 
Run-off from the site enters North Run, which is used for swimming within 1.5 miles of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : On December 3, 1987, the company entered into a Consent Order with EPA
under CERCLA Section 106. Under the order, the company will conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action. The work is scheduled to be completed in 1991.
