NPL Site Narrative for Industrial Lane
 
INDUSTRIAL LANE
Williams Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Industrial Lane Site is in Williams Township, south of
Easton, Pennsylvania. It includes a zoned industrial area and a 29-acre sanitary landfill located south
of Industrial Lane. The landfill has been in operation since the late 19th century. The current owners
purchased the Industrial Lane Site in 1958, at which time it was operating as an open dump. The owners
are currently operating under a State sanitary landfill permit and are negotiating with the State for closure
of a portion of the landfill and opening of a new area.
 
Several residences get drinking water from individual wells located between the landfill and the Lehigh
River. In July 1982, EPA detected hazardous substances, including lead, benzene, chloroform, and carbon
tetrachloride, in three private wells. The State and EPA are conducting a water sampling program of these
and other private wells in the area and are also continuing their investigation of all potential sources of
ground water contamination in the area.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is beginning a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and will discuss plans for the investigation at a public meeting.
