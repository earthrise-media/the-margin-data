NPL Site Narrative for Springfield
Township Dump
 
SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP DUMP
Davisburg, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Springfield Township Dump covers 5 acres near Davisburg
in rural Oakland County, Michigan. Between 1966 and 1968, and possibly longer, drums of liquid industrial
wastes (including paint sludges, solvents, PCBs, oils, and greases) were buried in or dumped into
the ground to reclaim the drums. In 1980, the State removed most contaminants. Most soils remain
contaminated with PCBs, other organic chemicals, and metals. Ground water below the dumping area is
also contaminated with organic chemicals, but nearby residential wells are not contaminated as yet.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
