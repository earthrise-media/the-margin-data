NPL Site Narrative for Pinette's Salvage
Yard
 
PINETTE'S SALVAGE YARD
Washburn, Maine
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Pinette's Salvage Yard is located 1 mile southwest of the town
of Washburn, Maine. In July 1979, three transformers filled with PCBs were removed from Loring Air
Force Base to Pinette's, which is privately owned. During unloading, the transformers broke, spilling their
contents onto an area measuring 40 feet by 40 feet. The oil migrated through the soil and may have
contaminated ground water and surface water. The main concern is the potential for direct contact with
highly contaminated soil.
 
Status (July 1983) : In December 1982, the State placed a temporary cap over the spill area. EPA is
preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full extent of
cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
