NPL Site Narrative for Avtex Fibers, Inc.
 
AVTEX FIBERS, INC.
Front Royal, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : A 340-acre site on the Shenandoah River in Front Royal,
Warren County, Virginia, has been operated as a rayon-manufacturing complex by American Viscose
(1940-1963), FMC Corp. (1963-1977), and Avtex Fibers, Inc. (1977 to the present). Various wastes
have been disposed of in unlined basins, landfills, and open piles. In 1974, FMC received a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to discharge waste water effluent into the South Fork of the
Shenandoah River.
 
Ground water under the site contains excessive levels of carbon disulfide, phenol, and arsenic, according
to analyses conducted by the State. Ground water directly across the river from the site contains excessive
levels of carbon disulfide and phenol. About 1,300 people use wells from the contaminated aquifer within 3
miles of the site as a source of drinking water. The South Fork of the Shenandoah River does not appear
to be affected by discharges from the plant at this time.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Avtex Fibers, Inc., is preparing a scope of work to perform a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. The company is pumping and treating ground water under the direction of
the State.
