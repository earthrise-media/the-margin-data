NPL Site Narrative for Airco Plating Co.
 
AIRCO PLATING CO.
Miami, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Airco Plating Co. has operated an electroplating shop on a 1.5-
acre site at 3650 N.W. 46th Street, Miami, Dade County, Florida, since 1957. Principal processes at the
plant involve nickel, cadmium, chromium, copper, and zinc plating. Prior to 1973, wastes from the plating
operations, including sludge, were disposed of in three on-site seepage ponds. Starting in 1973, plating
wastes were pretreated and then released into the Miami municipal sewage system. Since 1982, the
sludges have been separated and transported to a hazardous waste facility regulated under Subtitle C of
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
 
During a July 1985 investigation, EPA discovered that one of the areas believed to have been used for
waste disposal had been covered with asphalt pavement and a lawn. Soil and ground water from near the
ponds contained contaminants associated with electroplating.
 
During December 1986 and January 1987, EPA found cadmium, chromium, copper, and nickel in surface
and subsurface soil from near the ponds and the lawn area between the ponds. Shallow ground water from
these areas also contained high concentrations of the same heavy metals.
 
The site is the recharge zone of the Biscayne Aquifer, which EPA has designated as a sole source aquifer
under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The aquifer supplies drinking water for all of Dade County. Four
municipal well fields (the Upper and Lower Miami Springs, the Hialeah, and the John E. Preston) that
supply drinking water to 750,000 people are within 3 miles of the site. One well is within 10,200 feet of the
site. Wells in the contaminated area have been taken out of service.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : On May 18, 1989, Airco Plating entered a Consent Agreement with Dade
County. Under the order, Airco submitted a report to the county in August 1989 recommending additional
soil sampling and development of a remedial action plan.
