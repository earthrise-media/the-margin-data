NPL Site Narrative for Solvent Savers
 
SOLVENT SAVERS
Lincklaen, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Solvent Savers recovered solvents on a 13-acre site in
Lincklaen, New York, from 1967 to 1974. The owner and operator hauled waste solvents from Syracuse
area industries for reprocessing or disposal. Large quantities of bulk and drummed liquid, soil, and
semisolid wastes may have been dumped into two 15- to 20-foot-deep pits on the property. There are also
indications that a tanker was buried.
 
EPA and the State have conducted extensive investigations of the site, including sampling of soil, surface
water, stream sediment, and fish. Seven wells have been installed to monitor ground water, and buried
drums have been surveyed. PCBs, chloroform, tetrachloroethylene, phenol, naphthalene, and 1,2-
dichlorobenzene have been detected in ground water in the immediate vicinity.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
