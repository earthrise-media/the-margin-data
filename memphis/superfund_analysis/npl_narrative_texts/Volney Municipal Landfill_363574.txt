Landfill
 
VOLNEY MUNICIPAL LANDFILL
Town of Volney, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Volney Municipal Landfill covers 58 acres in the Town
of Volney, Oswego County, New York. The surrounding area is rural. About 200 residents are served
by private wells. Currently, the site is owned by Oswego County and operated by the Oswego County
Highway Department. Before the county purchased the landfill in 1975, it was privately owned and served
the Towns of Granby and Volney and the Village of Fulton. In 1974, approximately 8,000 barrels of wastes
from Pollution Abatement Services, Oswego, New York, which was placed on the NPL in September 1983,
were buried at the site. A significant leachate problem exists. Ground water is contaminated with benzene,
lead, and phenols, according to tests conducted by the State.
 
The State has entered into a Consent Order with Oswego County for control of the leachate problem and
closure of the site. The State is now reviewing the county's closure plan.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
The State approved the county's closure plan, and the landfill was closed in the fall of 1985.
