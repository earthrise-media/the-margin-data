NPL Site Narrative for Fried Industries
 
FRIED INDUSTRIES
East Brunswick Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Fried Industries formulates industrial cleaners and cleaning
agents on a 26-acre site in a rural-suburban area in East Brunswick Township, Middlesex County, New
Jersey. The area was previously a clay pit.
 
In December 1983, EPA, under a search warrant, found that hazardous wastes were improperly stored on-
site and that soil was contaminated with organic chemicals (including tetrachloroethylene and chloroform)
and copper. In a limited excavation, EPA found deteriorated buried drums. The total number is unknown.
There is a strong potential for the site to contaminate ground water and surface water. About 33,000
people in the surrounding area draw drinking water from wells. In a limited air survey, EPA detected above-
background levels of organic vapors on-site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : East Brunswick Township has provided hook-ups to a public water supply to
those residents whose wells have low-level contamination.
 
Using CERCLA emergency funds, EPA is emptying two storage tanks and one impoundment area which is
threatening to overflow onto the surface surrounding the site.
 
EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
