NPL Site Narrative for Moss-American Co.,
Inc. (Kerr-McGee Oil Co.)
 
MOSS-AMERICAN CO., INC. (KERR-MCGEE OIL CO.)
Milwaukee, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : From 1946 until 1976, Moss-American Co., Inc., a division of
Kerr-McGee Oil Co., treated railroad ties, telephone poles, and building materials with preservatives such
as creosote on a 90-acre site in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Creosote-soaked logs were stored and coated at
several areas in the plant. As a result, creosote and other coal tar distillates contaminated the site. The
old factory buildings were demolished in 1978, and creosote sludge and the most contaminated soils
were excavated and sent to a disposal site in Illinois. Creosote-like compounds from past operations,
however, continue to contaminate surface soil, ground water, and river sediments near the site, according
to analyses conducted by EPA.
 
The site, a portion of which is owned by the Milwaukee County Parks Commission, is adjacent to the Little
Menomonee River.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
