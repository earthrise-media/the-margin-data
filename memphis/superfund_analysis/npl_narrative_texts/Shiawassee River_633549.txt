NPL Site Narrative for Shiawassee River
 
SHIAWASSEE RIVER
Howell, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Shiawassee River Site is in Howell, Livingston County,
Michigan. Since 1969, the Cast Forge Co. has manufactured aluminum cast products in Howell. Until
1973, waste water contaminated by hydraulic fluids containing PCBs was discharged to the South Branch
of the Shiawassee River. From 1973 to 1977, waste water was discharged into a 400,000-gallon on-site
lagoon. Discharges from this lagoon, as well as periodic overflows, have contaminated nearby wetlands
and subsequently the Shiawassee River. In 1978 and 1979, the State detected high levels of PCBs in
soils around the site and in on-site monitoring wells. Concentrations above 1 part per million were found in
Shiawassee River sediments for 14 miles downstream of the plant. PCBs were also found in fish as far as
52 miles downstream of the plant.
 
In November 1977, the State filed suit against Cast Forge for PCB-contamination of the environment. The
case was settled through a Consent Judgment in June 1981. Under that settlement, the company removed
the lagoon, cleaned up PCB-contaminated soil and sediment from its property, and provided $750,000 for
restoration of the Shiawassee River.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State's program for dredging contaminated sediments from the South Branch of
the Shiawassee River began in June 1982.
