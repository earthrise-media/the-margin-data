NPL Site Narrative for Cecil Lindsey
 
CECIL LINDSEY
Newport, Arkansas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (December 30, 1982) : The Cecil Lindsey Site covers 4.5 acres near Newport,
Jackson Country, Arkansas. It is a privately owned and unpermitted operation that received industrial
wastes from the mid-1960s to about 1979 or 1980. Drums that previously held pesticides and oils
containing heavy metals were disposed of, along with wastes from various metal industries. Previously, the
City of Diaz used the site to dispose of municipal wastes.
 
Leachate from the sandy soils on the site contains heavy metals and organic compounds. Run-off and
flooding have the potential to contaminate shallow ground water under the site and nearby Village Creek, a
tributary to the White River.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
Status (September 22, 1989) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Arkansas, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA
has been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
