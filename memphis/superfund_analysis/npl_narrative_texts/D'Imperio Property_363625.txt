NPL Site Narrative for D'Imperio Property
 
D'IMPERIO PROPERTY
Hamilton Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The D'Imperio Property is a 1-acre inactive open dump bordered
by wooded property in Hamilton Township, Atlantic County, New Jersey. It is within 0.3 mile of a major
residential development. Prior to 1976, the site, believed to have been an old borrow pit, was used to
bury an unknown quantity of 55-gallon drums; 50 corroded drums are exposed. Ground water in the
upper aquifer is contaminated with benzene and chlorinated hydrocarbons, including benzene and
trichloroethylene. The lower aquifer, the Cohansey Aquifer, is a source of drinking water. Because there is
potential for the contamination to flow vertically, the lower aquifer could be contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : In September 1982, EPA signed a $368,000 Superfund State Contract with New
Jersey to fence the site and conduct a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action. The fence
is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983 and the study in the first quarter of 1984.
 
EPA has identified parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site and is seeking their
cooperation in the cleanup. The owner of the site filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in District Court
on April 22, 1983.
