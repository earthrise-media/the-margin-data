NPL Site Narrative for French, Ltd.
 
FRENCH, LTD.
Crosby, Texas
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The French, Ltd., site is an abandoned waste pit on 15 acres in
Crosby, Harris County, Texas. It is in the floodplain of the San Jacinto River and has been flooded on
several occasions. The site received approximately 100,000 barrels of industrial waste per year between
1966 and 1972. Wastes included heavy metals, phenols, PCBs, oil, grease, acids, and solvents. During
litigation with the State over violation of environmental law, the company declared bankruptcy and deeded
the site to the State in 1973. No wastes have been disposed of at the site since then. The pit is located in
permeable sands, and ground water is contaminated, as well as adjacent drainage ditches which discharge
to the San Jacinto River. Low levels of contamination were measured in the air in the immediate vicinity of
the pit.
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1982, EPA awarded a $437,000 Cooperative Agreement to Texas for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of
1983. In March 1983, EPA added $29,668 to the award.
 
In June, using about $83,000 in CERCLA emergency funds, EPA removed PCB-contaminated sludge from
the pit and sent it to an approved landfill for disposal.
