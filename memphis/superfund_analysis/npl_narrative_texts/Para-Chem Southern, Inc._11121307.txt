NPL Site Narrative for Para-Chem
Southern, Inc.
 
PARA-CHEM SOUTHERN, INC.
Simpsonville, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : Para-Chem Southern, Inc., has manufactured organic
solvents and adhesives on a 100-acre site near Simpsonville, Greenville County, South Carolina, since
1965. The area is rural and sparsely populated.
 
During 1975-1979, 800 to 1,600 drums of organic and inorganic wastes were buried in unlined trenches
in three parts of the site, according to information the company provided to EPA as required by CERCLA
Section 103(c). Waste water from the plant was disposed of in two unlined lagoons until November 1984,
when the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) issued Para-Chem
a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).
 
In October 1985, SCDHEC found manganese and several organic chemicals, including chloroform,
carbon tetrachloride, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, in on-site ground water; carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,2-
trichloroethane in off-site ground water and surface water; and arsenic, barium, manganese, nickel, and
zinc in sediments in on-site surface water. 1,1-Dichloroethylene, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
2-butanone, and tetrahydrofuran were found in on-site monitoring wells in tests conducted in July 1987 by
a Para-Chem consultant. An estimated 1,500 people obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles
of the site, the nearest within 1 mile.
 
SCDHEC placed the company under a joint waste water/hazardous waste Consent Order in February
1985, and in January 1986 fined the company for violating its NPDES permit. The order also addressed the
buried drums and a spill of 3,500 gallons of ethyl acrylate in January 1985. Since 1986, the company has
been fined twice for failure to meet its NPDES permit.
 
Under the Consent Order, Para-Chem excavated soil from the drum burial areas and filled in the two
lagoons. The soil was moved to a hazardous waste facility regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. The action was completed in 1987. During the action, ground water
contamination consistent with earlier analyses was detected.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
