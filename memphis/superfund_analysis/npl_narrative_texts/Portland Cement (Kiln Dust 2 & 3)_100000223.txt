Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Portland Cement Co. of Salt Lake City, Salt Lake
County, Utah, has disposed of kiln dust and old kiln bricks since sometime before 1983 at five locations
in the greater Salt Lake City area. The dust, an alkaline by-product of cement manufacturing collected in
baghouses from kiln stacks, has high concentrations of lead and arsenic. The old kiln bricks contain high
levels of heavy metals, including hexavalent chromium. The kiln dust and bricks are in piles on the surface
at Sites 2 and 3. There is no way to restrict public access to the site, which is in a mixed commercial,
industrial, and residential area. Disposal at Sites 2 and 3 ceased in December 1983. Since July 1980, the
City/County Health Department has cited Portland Cement for numerous dust violations.
 
Ground water in the vicinity of the site is contaminated with chromium, lead, and arsenic, according to tests
conducted by the State. About 100,000 people live within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a Consent Agreement with the State, Portland Cement Co. is conducting
a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action.
