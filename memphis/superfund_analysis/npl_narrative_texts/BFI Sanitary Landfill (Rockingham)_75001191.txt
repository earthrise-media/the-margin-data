NPL Site Narrative for BFI Sanitary Landfill
(Rockingham)
 
BFI SANITARY LANDFILL (ROCKINGHAM)
Rockingham, Vermont
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The BFI Sanitary Landfill covers 103 acres in Rockingham,
Windham County, Vermont, of which 25 acres are now in use. Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc., of Vermont
(BFI) purchased the landfill in 1977 from an individual who had started operations in 1968. In September
1983, the State certified the site as a municipal landfill that could accept hazardous waste from small
generators. Industrial wastes, including heavy metals, bases, pesticides, and volatile organic compounds,
were deposited in the unlined disposal area during 1968-79, according to State files. Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Co., Cone and Blanchard Machine Co., and Vermont Research Co. are known to have deposited
process wastes at the landfill.
 
According to the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation (VT DEC), nearby residential and
monitoring wells downgradient of the landfilling activities have been contaminated since 1979. Chromium,
lead, copper, trans-1,2-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, and 2-butanone were identified in 1983. More than
4,500 people in Vermont and New Hampshire obtain drinking water from public and private wells within
3 miles of the landfill. Several private wells have been contaminated from the landfill. The homes now
receive water from a new well provided by BFI.
 
The Connecticut River is 560 feet east of the site, along the drainage route of surface water.
 
VT DEC issued three Assurances of Discontinuance and Agreement between March 1980 and November
1983. The orders required BFI to determine the hydrogeology of the landfill, monitor ground water on-site,
and provide drinking water to affected nearby residents.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : VT DEC granted BFI Sanitary Landfill approval to operate as a solid waste
landfill until July 1, 1990. The approval expires in October 1989, unless BFI obtains a permit for this land-
use under Vermont Act 250. BFI's application is now under review.
 
EPA emergency staff is evaluating the site to determine if a removal action is warranted at this time.
