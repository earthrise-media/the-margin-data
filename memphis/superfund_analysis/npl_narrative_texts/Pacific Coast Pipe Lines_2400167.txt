NPL Site Narrative for Pacific Coast Pipe
Lines
 
PACIFIC COAST PIPE LINES
Fillmore, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Pacific Coast Pipe Lines Site covers 100 acres at 67 East
Telegraph Road in Fillmore, Ventura County, California. During 1920-52, the site was a Texaco, Inc.,
refinery. When the refinery closed, most of it was dismantled. Pacific Coast Pipe Lines, a department of
Texaco, took the site over in 1953, operating it as a crude oil pumping station.
 
Liquid and semisolid refinery wastes were disposed of in on-site unlined pits and sumps. Texaco identified
eight areas where hazardous waste may have been deposited. Soil in six of the areas contains benzene,
1,3-dichlorobenzene, and lead.
 
Three monitoring wells on-site contain benzene and 1,3-dichlorobenzene, according to Texaco analyses
conducted in 1983. An estimated 10,000 people obtain drinking water and as many as 4,000 acres of
agricultural land are irrigated from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
In 1985 and 1986, Texaco transported 33,000 cubic yards of contaminated soils to a hazardous waste
facility regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is investigating the possibility that Texaco will conduct a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action.
