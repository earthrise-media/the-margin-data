NPL Site Narrative for Mowbray
Engineering Co.
 
MOWBRAY ENGINEERING CO.
Greenville, Alabama
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Mowbray Engineering Co. Site covers about 4 acres in
Greenville, Butler County, Alabama. Between 1955 and 1974, the company drained, repaired, and refilled
an annual average of 1,000 used electrical transformers, each containing approximately 9 gallons of oil.
During this period, the waste oil, which contained PCBs, was discharged through a drainage system into
a nearby swamp. Ultimately, drainage discharged into Persimmon Creek, which was used for fishing.
In 1974, Mowbray installed a 3,000-gallon underground storage tank and sold the oil between 1974
and 1978. In 1978, Mowbray began to recycle the waste oil. A State investigation of a fish kill in 1975
implicated the company. Since then, several other investigations have been conducted in and near the site.
In early 1981, under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, EPA removed debris and contaminated soil from
the site. The total cost was about $130,000. Soil containing below 50 parts per million of PCBs remains on-
site.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is continuing to monitor the site.
