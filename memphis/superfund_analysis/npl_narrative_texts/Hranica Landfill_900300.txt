NPL Site Narrative for Hranica Landfill
 
HRANICA LANDFILL
Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Hranica Landfill is a 10-acre drum disposal and landfill
facility located in a farming community in Buffalo Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania. The privately-
owned landfill stopped accepting industrial waste in 1974. The site contains about 7,700 55-gallon drums
and larger vessels of waste composed of solvents, paint pigments, and metal sludges. A preliminary
investigation of the site by the generator of most of the waste showed that local soil, surface water, and
ground water may be contaminated with organic and inorganic compounds.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is attempting to negotiate with two parties potentially responsible for wastes
at the site.
