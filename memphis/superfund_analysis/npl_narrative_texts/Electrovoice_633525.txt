NPL Site Narrative for Electrovoice
 
ELECTROVOICE
Buchanan, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Electrovoice operates an electroplating plant on a 5-acre site
in Buchanan, Michigan. Until the late 1960s, the plant discharged waters into two seepage lagoons on-
site. Then the company stopped using the lagoons and removed much of the material already in them. In
1979, an industrial sewer link broke, discharging an unknown amount of plating wastes into the abandoned
lagoons. The company immediately treated and removed the discharge, repaired the line, and installed a
holding tank to prevent similar incidents in the future.
 
In January 1980, the State detected toluene and xylene in two of the four monitoring wells around the
lagoons and trichloreothylene in one of the lagoons.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA deferred rulemaking on this site in September 1983 to allow more time to resolve
technical issues related to its inclusion on the NPL. After further review and investigative work, EPA placed
the site on the NPL.
