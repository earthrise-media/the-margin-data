NPL Site Narrative for Bypass 601 Ground
Water Contamination
 
BYPASS 601 GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Concord, North Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1984) : The Bypass 601 Ground Water Contamination Site is in Concord,
Cabarrus County, North Carolina. An estimated 3,000 residents of this rural community on a bypass to
State Highway 601 depend exclusively on ground water for drinking and other household uses.
 
EPA recently detected high concentrations of heavy metals in monitoring wells near Martin Scrap &
Recycling, Inc., which has reclaimed batteries in the area since 1966.
 
Status (January 1986) : In July 1985, EPA completed a search for parties (in addition to Martin Scrap)
potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site. None of the parties chose to participate in
cleaning up the site. EPA has obligated funds to start work preparatory to a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action.
