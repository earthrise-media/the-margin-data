BROADWAY STREET CORR IDOR Anderson, Indiana 
Madison County GROUNDWATER CONTAMIN ATION 
Site Location: The Broadway Street Corridor Groundwater Contamination site consists of comingled plumes of chlorinated substances that have contaminated the groundwater in the city of Anderson, Indiana. The plume has contaminated one of the city’s two municipal well fields. 
•Site History: The contamination was first discovered in 1992. In 2011, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) reported trace concentrations of trichloroethene (TCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE), and cis -1,2-dichloroethene (cis-1,2 DCE) in the finished water at the treatmen t plant and referred the site to IDEM’s Site Investigation Program. In 2013, IDEM also found vinyl chloride in raw water. Despite several investigations in the area, the origin of the contaminants is unknown. 
•Site Contamination/Contaminants: Untreated water in municipal wells has been found to have concentrations of either TCE, PCE or vinyl chloride at or above their respective drinking water Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). 
•Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : Area residents are connected to the municipal water supply distribution systems and use municipal water as their drinking water. The contaminated wells provide drinking water to over 12,300 residents in Anderson, Indiana. The water is blended and treated before it is distributed to residents. 
•Response Activities (to date): IDEM has identified approximately five active and former facilities that could be contributing to the contamination. There are no past or current cleanup response actions at the site. Since 1999, the city has been treating the water with air strippers to reduce contaminant levels to below the Safe Drinking Water Act MCLs. 
•Need for NPL Listing: The state of Indiana referred the site to the EPA because the site requires further investigation and long term cleanup. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated but are not viable at this time. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from the state.  þ
[The description of the site (release) is based on information available at the time the site was evaluated with the HRS.
