NPL Site Narrative for Galen Myers Dump/
Drum Salvage
 
GALEN MYERS DUMP/DRUM SALVAGE
Osceola, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Galen Myers Dump/Drum Salvage Site covers 5 acres in
Osceola, St. Joseph County, Indiana. During approximately 1960-82, the owner stored and recycled 55-
gallon drums obtained from local industries. The tops were removed, the contents dumped into a pit and
driveway, and the drums sold as trash containers. In an inspection in July 1984, EPA found many leaking
and deteriorating drums on the site.
 
In 1985, using CERCLA emergency funds, EPA removed 277 drums of waste and contaminated soils and
transported them to a hazardous waste facility regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act. Residential wells sampled at the time showed low levels of contamination.
 
In late 1986 and 1987, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) found that soils
were still significantly contaminated with organic chemicals. In addition, two of four downgradient private
wells were contaminated with 1,1,1-trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane at
levels EPA considers unsafe. EPA provided mini-strippers and carbon filters for use in the contaminated
wells. IDEM provided operation and maintenance.
 
Soils on-site are sandy, making continued contamination of ground water possible. An estimated 17,000
people obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site. Ground water is shallow and flows south
toward the St. Joseph River approximately 1 mile away.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
