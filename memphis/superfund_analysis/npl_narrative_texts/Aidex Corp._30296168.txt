NPL Site Narrative for Aidex Corp.
 
AIDEX CORP.
Council Bluffs, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : A pesticide-formulating plant near Council Bluffs, Iowa, belonging
to Aidex Corp., caught fire in 1976. The 100,000 gallons of water used to fight the fire contaminated
the ground on the 15-acre site. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1980. More than 4,000 barrels of
pesticides and pesticide wastes are stored and buried on the property. A large underground tank and
concrete pit on the site also contain wastes. Soil, ground water, and surface water are contaminated.
 
This is the top priority site in Iowa.
 
Status (July 1983) : In December 1981, EPA fenced the property with $30,000 of CERCLA emergency
funds. In August 1982, EPA authorized $200,000 for a remedial investigation to determine the extent and
type of contamination at the site and a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work
is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983. In September 1982, EPA signed a Superfund
State Contract and Interagency Agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for $465,000. In March
1983, the funding was increased to $680,000 to cover initial remedial measures to clean up surface soils
and drums, empty the tank and pit, and control erosion from areas with highly contaminated soils. A
contractor for the cleanup was hired in April 1983. The work is scheduled to be completed in early fall of
1983.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, has brought a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief
against parties partially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
