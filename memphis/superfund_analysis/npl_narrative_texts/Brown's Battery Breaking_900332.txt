NPL Site Narrative for Brown's Battery
Breaking
 
BROWN'S BATTERY BREAKING
Shoemakersville, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Brown's Battery Breaking Site is an abandoned battery
recycling facility which operated in a rural area near Shoemakersville, Berks County, Pennsylvania, from
1961 to 1971. About 25,000 cubic yards of battery casings were found on the site, either whole or in
pieces. In some instances, small pieces were used as a substitute for road gravel in the area.
 
The State detected lead in air near the site, in surface and subsurface soils on the site, and downstream in
the Schuylkill River, which adjoins the site. The State found elevated blood lead levels in children living on
the site.
 
Approximately 1,000 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
In 1983-84, EPA spent $1.4 million in CERCLA emergency funds to fence the site, excavate, consolidate,
and cap contaminated soils on-site, and regravel the driveway leading into the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In March 1985, EPA filed a complaint in the Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania
against General Battery Corp. and another potentially responsible party for costs incurred during the
emergency operations.
 
The State is developing a final workplan for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
