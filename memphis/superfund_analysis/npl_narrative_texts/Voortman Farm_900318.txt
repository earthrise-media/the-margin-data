NPL Site Narrative for Voortman Farm
 
VOORTMAN FARM
Upper Saucon Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (December 30, 1982) : The Voortman Farm Site in Upper Saucon Township,
Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, is a sinkhole 48 feet in diameter and 120 feet deep. In the mid-1970s, an
estimated 10,000 battery casings were dumped on the privately owned property. The State detected
elevated concentrations of various heavy metals in the sinkhole. Analyses of nearby domestic wells show
heavy metals at below the maximum permissible limits.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : By January 1983, inspections by the State had revealed that the battery
casings were no longer in the sinkhole. EPA plans to inspect the site later in 1983.
 
Status (May 31, 1989) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under
CERCLA has been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
