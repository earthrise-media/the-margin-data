NPL Site Narrative for Wheeling Disposal
Service Co., Inc., Landfill
 
WHEELING DISPOSAL SERVICE CO., INC., LANDFILL
Amazonia, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : Wheeling Disposal Service Co., Inc., operates a landfill on
two contiguous areas covering approximately 200 acres. The site is approximately 1 mile southeast of
Amazonia in Andrew County, Missouri.
 
The landfill was established in the early 1970s. Between June 1980 and September 1981, the company
voluntarily ceased operations pending the issuance of State and Federal regulations on hazardous waste
disposal facilities. In September 1981, the facility resumed operations under the authority of a special
waste disposal permit issued by the State of Missouri. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources
(MDNR) has periodically inspected and monitored ground water at the site since 1975.
 
Based on monthly MDNR hazardous waste logs, wastes containing pesticides (including heptachlor,
toxaphene, and lindane), cyanide, arsenic, sulfide, nickel, cadmium, lead, zinc, asbestos, paint sludge, and
tanning sludge were disposed at this landfill.
 
In field investigations conducted by EPA in December 1980, November 1982, and November 1983,
trichloroethylene, chloroform, and 1,2-dichloroethane were detected in monitoring wells and springs on-site
at concentrations significantly above background levels.
 
Drinking water is supplied to approximately 300 residents of Amazonia and 4,200 residents of Savannah
through wells into the Missouri River alluvial aquifer that are within 1 to 2 miles of the site. Shallow ground
water beneath the site provides partial recharge to the aquifer.
 
Mace Creek, 4,000 feet downslope from the landfill, is threatened by drainage from the site. Local surface
waters are used for fishing.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : In 1987, the owner/operator began closing procedures at the site. In September
1988, EPA, the owner/operator of the site, and six companies that transported wastes to the site entered
into an Administrative Order under CERCLA Sections 104 and 122. Under the order, the seven responsible
parties are conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. Field work started in January 1989.
