NPL Site Narrative for Old Inland Pit
 
OLD INLAND PIT
Spokane, Washington
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Old Inland Pit covers about 10 acres in an industrial park
in Spokane, Spokane County, Washington. The property was owned by Inland Asphalt Co. from 1969 to
1976, when it was sold to individuals who at one time were associated with the company.
 
In 1976, baghouse emission dusts from Spokane Steel Foundry Co. were placed in the unlined gravel pit
at the site. The foundry manufactures iron and steel parts across the road from the Old Inland Pit. The
pit continues to receive wastes, and during a recent EPA inspection there was evidence that baghouse
emission dusts apparently continue to be dumped.
 
Wastes in the pit contain toxic metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead) and organic chemicals
(acetone, methylene chloride, toluene, and trichloroethylene), according to tests conducted by EPA.
 
The site overlies the Spokane Valley-Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer, designated by EPA as a sole source
aquifer under the Safe Drinking Act. Within 3 miles of the site, it provides drinking water to more than
30,000 people. The soil is permeable so that contaminants can move into ground water.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
