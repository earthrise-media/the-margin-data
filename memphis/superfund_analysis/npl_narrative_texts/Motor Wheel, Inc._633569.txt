NPL Site Narrative for Motor Wheel, Inc.
 
MOTOR WHEEL, INC.
Lansing, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Motor Wheel, Inc., disposed of solvents, acids, and
bases on a 25-acre site in Lansing, Ingham County, Michigan. Wastes were buried in containers and
placed in seepage ponds from 1938 to 1979. Analyses conducted by the State indicate that the upper
aquifer is contaminated with several hazardous substances. To date, contamination of the lower aquifer,
which provides drinking water to Lansing, has not been documented, according to a study Motor Wheel
conducted under a consent agreement with the State. About 167,000 people depend on wells within 3
miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Motor Wheel has removed a number of containers of wastes from the site, but contaminated soils still
remain.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The State is negotiating with B.F. Goodyear, a party potentially responsible for
wastes associated with the site, regarding a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
