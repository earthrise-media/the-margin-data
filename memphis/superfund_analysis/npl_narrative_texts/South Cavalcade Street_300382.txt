NPL Site Narrative for South Cavalcade
Street
 
SOUTH CAVALCADE STREET
Houston, Texas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The South Cavalcade Street Site covers approximately
69 acres in Houston, Harris County, Texas. The site, located in an industrial area on the south side
of Cavalcade Street, has a history of wood-treating operations dating to 1911. Contaminants at the
site consist of polynuclear aromatic compounds associated with creosote, in addition to other similar
contaminants. EPA's analysis of historical aerial photographs indicates there are at least three waste
pits on the site that have been filled or paved over. Analyses conducted by EPA indicate widespread on-
site contamination of soil (both on and below the surface) and shallow ground water with benzopyrene,
chrysene, fluoranthene, and anthracene.
 
About 10,000 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In March 1985, Koppers Co., Inc., which has been identified as potentially
responsible for wastes associated with the site, signed an Administrative Order on Consent with EPA. The
order covers a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. EPA has completed a workplan for the RI/FS. All
prefield activities have been completed to EPA specifications, and Koppers is presently conducting the field
phase of the RI/FS.
