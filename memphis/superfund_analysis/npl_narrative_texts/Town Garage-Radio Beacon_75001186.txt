NPL Site Narrative for Town Garage/Radio
Beacon
 
TOWN GARAGE/RADIO BEACON
Londonderry, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Holton Circle is a development of about 25 lots in Londonderry,
Rockingham County, New Hampshire. The NPL site is defined as a series of residential wells and one
commercial well, the "Town Garage" well. According to tests conducted in 1984 by the New Hampshire
Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission, the wells are contaminated with 1,1-dichloroethylene
and 1,1-dichloroethane. The area consists of mixed rural and residential properties and is being actively
developed. An estimated 8,300 people obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of Holton
Circle.
 
The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and EPA have been investigating this area
since 1985 and have not yet verified a source of the contamination. The Department of Defense owned
Town Garage, located 1,000 feet west of Holton Circle, from the early 1940s to 1968 and operated a radio
beacon there during World War II.
 
EPA has also investigated a small auto repair shop about 1,000 feet south of Holton Circle. The shop uses
1-2 gallons of degreasing solvents annually.
 
Status (March 31, 1988) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
