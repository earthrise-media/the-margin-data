NPL Site Narrative for Bridgeport Rental &

BRIDGEPORT RENTAL & OIL SERVICES
Bridgeport, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Bridgeport Rental & Oil Services (BROS) is a 27.2-acre site in
Bridgeport, Gloucester County, New Jersey. It is adjacent to Cedar Swamp, a tidal area. Little Timber
Creek, a tributary of the Delaware River, borders the site. The company operated from 1969 until 1980.
The site holds more than 80 tanks and process vessels, drums, tank trucks, and a 11.8-acre unlined
lagoon. The lagoon contains an estimated 50 million gallons of oil, oil-water emulsions, contaminated
water, and sludge. The wastes, which contain heavy metals, PCBs, and other organic compounds, have
seeped into the soil and contaminate surface waters and ground water supplying private drinking wells.
 
In the spring of 1981, $200,000, made available through Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, was used
to lower the level of the lagoon, which was overflowing from heavy rains. In September 1981, with
$410,000 made available through the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, EPA started a remedial
investigation to determine the extent and type of contamination and to evaluate alternative water supplies
for local residents.
 
Status (July 1983) : In summer 1982, the lagoon was lowered again, this time with $200,000 in CERCLA
emergency funds. Also, a plan for an initial remedial measure was developed to lower the lagoon an
additional 8 to 10 feet, treat the aqueous phase, discharge the water to Little Timber Creek, and dispose
of the wastes off-site. A Superfund State Contract signed in December 1982 approved $3.3 million for site
cleanup, $2.8 million of it to implement the plan. The design phase is scheduled to be completed in the
third quarter of 1983. Funds are also provided for a feasibility study to identify alternatives for long-term
remedial action at the site. It is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 1984.
 
In June 1982, the Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA entered into a Consent Decree with the owners
and operators of the site under Section 7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
