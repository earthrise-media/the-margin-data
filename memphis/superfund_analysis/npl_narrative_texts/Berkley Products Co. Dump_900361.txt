NPL Site Narrative for Berkley Products
Co. Dump
 
BERKLEY PRODUCTS CO. DUMP
Denver, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Berkley Products Co. Dump covers 2 acres in Denver,
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The area is rural, with about 25 homes bordering the site. From the
1930s until 1965, a privately owned operation accepted municipal waste, which was burned or buried. In
1965, Lipton Paint and Varnish Co., a subsidiary of Berkley Products Co., purchased the site. Lipton buried
municipal waste mixed with organic solvents, paint wastes, resins, and pigment sludges on the site. When
operations stopped in 1970, the site was covered and seeded. In September 1970, it was purchased by the
present owner, who lives on the site.
 
In August 1984, EPA detected barium, lead, mercury, benzene, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, and diethyl
phthalate in leachate seeping from the site and in an off-site private well 300 feet downgradient of the site.
An estimated 450 people obtain drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the site. No municipal
supply is available in the area.
 
Cocalico Creek, which is about 2 miles downstream of the site, supplements the Denver Municipal
Authority main water supply. The system serves an estimated 2,000 people.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is conducting a search to identify parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site and will then negotiate with them to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination and identify alternatives for remedial action.
