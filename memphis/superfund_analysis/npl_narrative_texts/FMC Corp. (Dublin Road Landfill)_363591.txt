FMC CORP. (DUBLIN ROAD LANDFILL)
Town of Shelby, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : FMC Corp.'s Dublin Road Landfill covers 6 acres in the
Town of Shelby, Orleans County, New York. FMC acquired the site from Niagara Sprayer and Chemical
Corp. in 1943 and used it to dispose of wastes from repackaging and production of various chemicals.
According to FMC, the chemicals included lead, mercury, arsenic, and a variety of phenolic compounds
and pesticides (DDT, DDD, and DDE). The quantity of hazardous wastes is unknown. Past investigations
and sampling by a consultant to FMC documented the release of contaminants to ground water and
surface water in the vicinity of the site.
 
Several hundred people draw drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the landfill. The nearest
well is within 1,500 feet of the landfill.
 
The State has issued an Order on Consent requiring FMC to undertake further field investigations, monitor
the migration of contaminants, and take necessary remedial action.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : FMC has conducted further studies, and the reports are currently under review by
the State.
