NPL Site Narrative for Belvidere Municipal
Landfill
 
BELVIDERE MUNICIPAL LANDFILL
Belvidere, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Belvidere Municipal Landfill covers 11.3 acres in Belvidere,
Boone County, Illinois. It was active from 1939 until September 1973. When it closed, the site was
inadequately covered with sandy soil excavated from a borrow pit and soil left over from highway
construction just south of the facility. The site is incompletely fenced and mostly overgrown with natural
grasses. Leachate streams are visible on the west and northwest sides of the fill.
 
Monitoring wells installed by the State detected PCBs, toluene, xylenes, and other toxic organic
compounds. A puddle beneath one of the leachate plumes on the northwest side of the fill contains
relatively high concentrations of ethylbenzene and toluene.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
