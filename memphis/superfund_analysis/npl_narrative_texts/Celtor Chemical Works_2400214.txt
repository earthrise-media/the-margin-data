NPL Site Narrative for Celtor Chemical
Works
 
CELTOR CHEMICAL WORKS
Hoopa, California
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Celtor Chemical Works Site covers about 2 acres in Hoopa,
within the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation in the forested mountains in Humboldt County in northern
California. The Trinity River, which supports the only fisheries resources for the Hoopa Indians, flows
through the center of the reservation and near the site. Land in the vicinity of Celtor is used for agriculture,
residential areas, and industrial/commercial enterprises.
 
From 1957 until 1962, copper, zinc, and precious metals were recovered on-site from sulfide ore mined
and trucked to Celtor from nearby Copper Bluff Mine. Significant levels of cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury,
zinc, and copper have been found at the site, which children on the reservation now use as a play area.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is investigating the site further to gather the information needed to start a
feasibility study, which will identify alternatives for remedial action.
