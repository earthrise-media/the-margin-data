MEDLEY FARM DRUM DUMP
Gaffney, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Medley Farm Drum Dump covers 7 acres in Gaffney,
a rural area in Cherokee County, South Carolina. In about 1973, an unknown person buried about
5,400 drums and dug six lagoons in a clearing in the woods of the Medley Farm. On June 1, 1983, an
anonymous caller informed the State of the site. At the State's request, EPA investigated and found that
all the drums were rusted and some had leaked or were leaking. EPA analyses indicated that the drums
contained numerous flammable organic liquids, including toluene, benzene, vinyl chloride, and PCBs.
The six unlined lagoons held 70,000 gallons of contaminated rain water and tons of sludges. On June
21, 1983, EPA started to clean up the site using CERCLA emergency funds. EPA removed 2,400 cubic
yards of contaminated soil and sludges plus the drums and their contents (25,000 gallons of liquids)
and transported the materials to a hazardous waste facility regulated under Subtitle C of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. The liquids in the lagoons were treated on-site and discharged. The
lagoons were then filled in.
 
Ground water on and off the site is contaminated with volatile organic chemicals, including chloroform
and 1,1,2-trichloroethane, according to tests conducted by the South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control. About 120 people draw drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Thickety Creek, a tributary of Jones Creek, is about 300 feet downgradient of the site. Surface and
subsurface flows are such that Thickety Creek is threatened.
 
During its search for parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site, EPA in March 1985
identified National Starch and Chemical Corp. as having deposited wastes at the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : On January 28, 1987, EPA filed suit under CERCLA Section 107 to recover the
costs of its emergency action in 1983. National Starch, along with five other responsible parties, settled the
suit.
 
On January 29, 1988, National Starch entered into an Administrative Order on Consent under CERCLA
Sections 104 and 122 requiring the company to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The
work is scheduled to be completed late in 1990.
