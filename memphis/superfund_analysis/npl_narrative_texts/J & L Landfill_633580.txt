NPL Site Narrative for J & L Landfill
 
J & L LANDFILL
Rochester Hills, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The J&L Landfill covers 17 acres on Hamlin Road in Rochester
Hills, Oakland County, Michigan. The area is heavily industrialized. Recently, the owner, Jones & Laughlin
Steel Corp., assumed the name of its parent company, LTV Steel Co.
 
While the landfill operated (1951 to 1980), approximately 1.5 million cubic feet of wastes, including dusts
from emission control devices in electric furnaces, were buried at depths of up to 25 feet. Avon Township
zoning board granted special use permits for the operation. Dusts at the site contain manganese,
chromium, and nickel, according to the company.
 
The landfill has no liner and is located in a stratification consisting of sands and gravels extending between
18 and 35 feet below the surface. These materials facilitate the movement of contaminants into ground
water. About 1,500 people depend on shallow wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
The nearest well is less than 2,000 feet from the site.
 
Ladd Drain borders the site and flows into Clinton River, which flows through the Rochester-Utica
Recreation Area less than 1 mile from the landfill.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
