NPL Site Narrative for City Disposal Corp.
Landfill
 
CITY DISPOSAL CORP. LANDFILL
Dunn, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : City Disposal Corp. (owned by Waste Management of
Wisconsin, Inc.) filled about 35 acres of a 58-acre landfill in the Town of Dunn, Dane County, Wisconsin,
from 1969 to 1978. In a separate area, the operator buried an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 drums of
industrial wastes (including solvents from the plastic fabrication industry and a water-lube oil mixture) and
smaller quantities of paint waste. The site is less than 400 feet from a branch of Bad Fish Creek, and there
is a potential to contaminate ground water. The landfill, now closed and covered, is unlined and rests on
silty soils.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is negotiating for cleanup of the site by a party potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site.
