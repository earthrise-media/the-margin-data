NPL Site Narrative for Oakdale Dump
 
OAKDALE DUMP
Oakdale, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Oakdale Dump covers 40 acres in Oakdale, Washington
County, Minnesota. The site consists of three adjoining properties that were used for the disposal of
industrial wastes during the 1950s. The three (named for the property owner at the time of disposal) are:
Abresch (the largest), a wetland in which a number of large trenches were excavated for waste burial;
Brockman, used for disposal when the water level was high at Abresch; and Eberle, where solvents were
spilled on the ground and ignited. Many thousands of drums of waste appear to be buried on the site,
plus large quantities of other solid industrial wastes. Ground water and surface water in the area are
contaminated with a wide variety of organic chemicals, including acetone and isopropyl ether.
 
Status (July 1983) : 3M Corp., possibly one of the waste contributors, has removed surface materials and
cleaned up several children's play areas on the site. 3M, the State, and EPA have reached an agreement
in principle under which 3M will undertake complete remedial work at the site, including treatment of
ground water.
