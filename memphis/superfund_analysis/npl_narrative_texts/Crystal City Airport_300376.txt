NPL Site Narrative for Crystal City Airport
 
CRYSTAL CITY AIRPORT
Crystal City, Texas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Crystal City Airport covers about 100 acres in Crystal
City, Zavala County, Texas. Aerial applicator companies that are no longer in business have contaminated
several large areas at the airport with a variety of pesticides.
 
The city brought the site to the attention of the State in April 1983. In its initial inspection, the State found
at least 50 drums in various stages of decomposition. Analyses of soil samples detected high levels of
chlordane, DDT, methyl and ethyl parathion, toxaphene, 2,4-D, and 2,4,5-T.
 
Beginning in October 1983, EPA spent $60,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to remove the drums, soil
around the drums, and soil with the highest concentrations of pesticides. High concentrations of pesticides
are still on-site, so there is a potential for hazardous substances to become airborne. One of the primary
drinking water wells for Crystal City is near the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State received funds in September
1985 to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The State is selecting a contractor.
