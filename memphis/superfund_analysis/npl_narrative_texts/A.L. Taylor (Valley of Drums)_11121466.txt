NPL Site Narrative for A.L. Taylor (Valley
of Drums)
 
A.L. TAYLOR (VALLEY OF DRUMS)
Brooks, Kentucky
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The A.L. Taylor ("Valley of the Drums") Site covers 13 acres in
Brooks, Kentucky, 12 miles south of Louisville. It was used as a refuse dump, drum recycling center,
and chemical dump from 1967 to 1977. The chemical wastes were largely from the paint and coatings
industries of Louisville. Air, surface water, ground water, and soil are contaminated with organic and
inorganic chemicals.
 
EPA conducted emergency response activities in March 1979 under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act,
and in September 1981 under CERCLA, at a total cost of $650,000. Through these response activities and
voluntary removal of wastes by known generators, a majority of the surface wastes (about 17,000 drums)
were removed. A system was installed to control and treat contaminated run-off from the site.
 
This is the top priority site in Kentucky.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA has completed a feasibility study identifying alternatives for cleanup of
subsurface contamination. The State and EPA Region IV have agreed on the preferred alternative, and
it was presented at a public meeting in June 1983. A $1.4 million Cooperative Agreement to provide
Kentucky with the funds for cleanup is being negotiated.
