NPL Site Narrative for Hooker (102nd
Street)
 
HOOKER (102ND STREET)
Niagara Falls, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Hooker portion of the 102nd Street Landfill covers 16
acres east of Griffon Park in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New York. From 1943 to 1975, Occidental
Chemicals Corp. (formerly known as Hooker Chemicals and Plastics Corp.) dumped approximately 23,000
tons of chemical waste at the site, including hexachlorocyclohexanes, organic phosphates, chlorinated
hydrocarbons (including chlorinated benzenes and toluenes), benzyl chloride, benzoyl, and acids.
 
Both surface water and ground water are contaminated. The point where wastes have leached into the
Niagara River is about 2.8 miles upstream of the intake tunnels for Niagara Falls' water treatment plant,
which serves about 77,000 people. Besides contamination of the river and the city's drinking water supply,
the other major concern is the contamination of Lake Erie.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, has brought a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief
against parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
