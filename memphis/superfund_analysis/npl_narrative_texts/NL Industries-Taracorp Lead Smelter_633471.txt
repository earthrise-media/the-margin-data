NPL Site Narrative for NL Industries/
Taracorp Lead Smelter
 
NL INDUSTRIES/TARACORP LEAD SMELTER
Granite City, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The NL Industries/Taracorp Lead Smelter covers
approximately 25 acres in Granite City, Madison County, Illinois. Taracorp purchased the facility in August
1979 from NL Industries, which had operated it since 1928. Taracorp reclaims lead from battery cases and
other scrap.
 
On the site is a waste pile approximately 20 feet high made up of 225,000 tons of broken batteries, blast
furnace slag, and other lead waste. The pile appears stable, but run-off is evident. The State detected
140,000 to 300,000 parts per million lead in soil near the pile. Past and current air emissions associated
with the smelting operations and the waste pile have contaminated off-site surface soils as far away as 0.5
mile, according to the State. Ground water contamination has not been documented to date.
 
About 15,000 people live within 1 mile of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA and the State signed a Consent Order with NL Industries on March 11,
1985. The order calls for the company to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. A workplan and
sampling plan are due shortly.
