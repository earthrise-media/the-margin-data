NPL Site Narrative for Williams Property
 
WILLIAMS PROPERTY
Swainton, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Williams Property is an abandoned waste dump covering
5.6 acres in a rural-agricultural region of Swainton, Cape May County, New Jersey. The property is near
coastal wetlands and wildlife management areas. Surface water bodies are used for recreation, while
aquifers supply water for about 60 percent of the population of Cape May County.
 
The State drilled and sampled monitoring wells on the site. Analysis revealed high concentrations of toxic
and highly volatile organics. The shallow Holly Beach Aquifer has been polluted by the dumping, confirmed
by records, of about 225 drums of liquid hazardous wastes in 1979. During initial inspections, the State
observed heavy organic odors, extensive soil contamination, and damaged vegetation. The State removed
about 1,200 cubic yards of contaminated soil and transported it to the Browning-Ferris Industries Landfill in
Glen Burnie, Maryland.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
