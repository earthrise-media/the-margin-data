NPL Site Narrative for Wamchem, Inc.
 
WAMCHEM, INC.
Burton, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Until the late 1970s, Wamchem, Inc., synthesized organic
chemicals and formulated color concentrates on 200 acres in Burton, Beaufort County, South Carolina. It
disposed of its wastes (including phenols, lead, cadmium, and solvents) in an evaporation lagoon. Then
it switched to spraying its wastes onto two fields. State monitoring of wells on-site has detected lead,
chromium, toluene, dichloronitroethane, and benzene. Some 1,000 to 2,000 people get drinking water from
the shallow aquifer within 3 miles of the site. Surface water is contaminated with the same chemicals, but it
does not supply drinking water at this time.
 
Status (June 1984) : The company is conducting further ground water studies to determine the impact of
the spray fields and disposal lagoon.
