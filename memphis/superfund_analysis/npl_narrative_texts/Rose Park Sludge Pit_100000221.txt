NPL Site Narrative for Rose Park Sludge
Pit
 
ROSE PARK SLUDGE PIT
Salt Lake City, Utah
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Rose Park Sludge Pit covers 5 acres in Salt Lake City, Utah. It
was used for the disposal of petroleum wastes from the 1920s until 1957. Sludges were placed into unlined
pits and sometimes covered with lime and soil. The site has been fenced, but the sludge exposed at this
site can directly contact park users.
 
This is the top priority site in Utah.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA, the State, the city, and Amoco (which had purchased the company that
deposited the wastes on the site) reached an agreement for cleanup. Amoco constructed a slurry wall and
will construct a clay cap to isolate the sludge. Construction of the clay cap is scheduled for completion in
July 1983. Amoco and Salt Lake City each contributed $45,000 to pay for ground water monitoring around
the outside of the slurry wall for 30 years.
