NPL Site Narrative for University of
Minnesota (Rosemount Research Center)
 
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA (ROSEMOUNT RESEARCH
CENTER)
Rosemount, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The University of Minnesota formerly operated a 4-acre
disposal site in Rosemount, a rural area in Dakota County, Minnesota. Between 1960 and 1973, the
University buried or incinerated gaseous, liquid, and solid chemical laboratory wastes on the site. In 1972,
the University detected volatile organic chemicals and heavy metals in monitoring wells and soil on the site.
 
New monitoring data collected by the State in July 1984 indicate that the contamination is spreading. As a
result, the State is beginning an enforcement action against the University.
 
Due to the contamination, the State is supplying bottled water to 28 families in Rosemount. About 9,600
people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under State order, the University is starting a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action. The order also calls for removal of contaminated soil and monitoring of ground water.
