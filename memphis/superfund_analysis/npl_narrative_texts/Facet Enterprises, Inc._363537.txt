FACET ENTERPRISES, INC.
Elmira, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Facet Enterprises, Inc., manufactures motor components on a 31-
acre site in Elmira, New York. On-site are numerous discrete areas including waste pits, lagoons, and
surface dumps. Wastes known to have been disposed of at the site include: cyanide salts, heavy metal
sludges, spent solvents, and various quenching and cutting oils. Heavy metals and PCBs have been
detected in the soil, and trichloroethylene (TCE) and other volatile organics in on-site drainage ditches that
flow into nearby creeks. Ground water appears to be the contamination route of major concern. TCE has
been detected at Facet's process well about 2,000 feet east of the site and at the Elmira Water Board's
Sullivan Street Well about 2 miles south. The site is adjacent to a residential area and is less than 200 feet
from the nearest house.
 
Status (July 1983) : Facet has entered into an administrative order on consent with EPA to study
hydrogeologic conditions at the site. The study is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983.
