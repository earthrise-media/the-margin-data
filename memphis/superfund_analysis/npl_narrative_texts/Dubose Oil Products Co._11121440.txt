NPL Site Narrative for Dubose Oil
Products Co.
 
DUBOSE OIL PRODUCTS CO.
Cantonment, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Dubose Oil Products Co. recovered waste oil from early
1979 through November 1981 on a 20-acre site west of Cantonment, Escambia County, Florida. At the
request of the State Department of Environmental Regulation (DER), EPA took water and sediment
samples in April 1982. Analysis of the samples detected elevated concentrations of numerous organic
compounds. An estimated 2,400 people draw drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
The State has completed a hydrogeologic assessment of the site. In January and February 1984, the State
removed contaminated drums from the site. The State has filed a civil complaint against the company.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : At the end of 1984 and the beginning of 1985, DER excavated about 40,000
cubic yards of contaminated soil and placed it in a lined vault on-site to prevent further contamination of
ground water. Water from three contaminated ponds is being pumped out and treated to remove organic
chemicals. In the spring of 1985, EPA, DER, and a group of parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site held a series of meetings. The parties formed a steering committee and hired a
consultant to perform a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site.
