NPL Site Narrative for BEC Trucking
 
BEC TRUCKING
Vestal, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The BEC Trucking Site is a 3.5-acre vacant lot in the Town
of Vestal, Broome County, New York. The site was formerly owned by the Binghamton Equipment Co.,
a truck manufacturer. After the firm declared bankruptcy in 1982, COGS, Inc., purchased the property at
public auction.
 
A State inspection discovered about 40 drums of waste machine oils and unknown materials improperly
stored at the site. Many of the drums are rusted and leaking. The soil nearby is oil-soaked. The remainder
of the site is littered with empty drums, trash barrels, and other debris.
 
There is a potential to contaminate ground water and surface water near the site. A Vestal Water District
Well Field is about 4,500 feet north-northeast of the site and serves approximately 3,700 people. Two
Vestal wells were placed on the NPL in September 1983.
 
The State is negotiating with COGS, Inc., for further monitoring and remedial action.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
