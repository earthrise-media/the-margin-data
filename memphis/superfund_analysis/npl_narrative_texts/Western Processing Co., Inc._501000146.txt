NPL Site Narrative for Western Processing
Co., Inc.
 
WESTERN PROCESSING CO., INC.
Kent, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Western Processing Co., Inc., Site covers 10 acres south of
Seattle in Kent, Washington. The principal operations are recovery of solvents, neutralization of acid and
basic wastes, and precipitation of heavy metals. Other chemical and/or physical processes are used on
a batch basis. Hazardous materials are stored directly on the ground and have entered the environment
from leaks and spills. In the past, as a means of disposal, wastes were buried on-site. In 1981, and again
in 1982, EPA ordered Western Processing to meet the hazardous waste requirements of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. The company did not comply.
 
Status (July 1983) : Recent EPA studies indicate that hazardous contaminants have migrated off-site
in surface water and that soil and ground water beneath the site are grossly contaminated. As a result,
in April 1983, EPA ordered the company to stop accepting or processing hazardous substances and to
remedy the contamination. The company stated it was unable to undertake the remedy. EPA, using $1.5
million in CERCLA emergency funds, undertook measures to stabilize the site. Further investigation is now
underway to more completely assess the extent of contamination on and off the site and to determine an
appropriate remedy.
