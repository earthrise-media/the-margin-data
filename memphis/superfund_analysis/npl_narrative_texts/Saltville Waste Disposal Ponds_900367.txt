NPL Site Narrative for Saltville Waste
Disposal Ponds
 
SALTVILLE WASTE DISPOSAL PONDS
Saltville, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Saltville Waste Disposal Ponds Site consists of two ponds
adjacent to the North Fork of the Holston River, at Saltville, Smyth County, Virginia. Between 1951 and
1972, chlorine and caustic soda were produced at a plant near the ponds. Although the plant itself has
been demolished, the ponds remain, with approximately 11 million tons of mercury-contaminated waste.
Discharges from past operation of the plant and leachate from the ponds have contaminated 50 miles of
the North Fork of the Holston River with mercury. Since September 1970, this portion of the river has been
closed to fishing for eating purposes (game fishing is allowed on a "catch and release" basis).
 
A task force comprised of EPA (Region III), Virginia State Water Control Board, Tennessee Valley
Authority, and the Tennessee Department of Public Health was organized in 1979 to study the mercury
contamination problem. Several steps have already been taken under a State order to stop discharges
from the waste ponds, and portions of the river were dredged in 1982 to remove mercury-contaminated
sediments.
 
Status (July 1983) : The river is being monitored to measure the effectiveness of the cleanup measures.
