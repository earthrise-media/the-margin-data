NPL Site Narrative for Big D Campground
 
BIG D CAMPGROUND
Kingsville, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Big D Campground, a 10-acre site in Kingsville, Ohio, was
originally a sand and gravel pit. From 1964 to 1976, wastes, some known to be hazardous, were dumped
in the pit. Leachate from the site is contaminating Conneaut Creek with chlorobenzene. There is potential
for contamination of ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : After negotiating with the State, one of the companies responsible for sending wastes
to the facility has completed a soil erosion control program.
 
EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full
extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
