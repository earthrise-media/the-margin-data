NPL Site Narrative for Rose Township
Dump
 
ROSE TOWNSHIP DUMP
Rose Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Rose Township Dump covers 10 acres. It is one of three sites
within a 5-square-mile area in Rose Township, Oakland County, Michigan. About 5,000 drums of liquid
industrial wastes (paint sludges, solvents, oils, PCBs, and greases) were buried or deposited on the
surface of the three sites. Some may have been emptied into the ground or pits so that the drums could
be recycled. The State removed most drums in 1980. Ground water, surface water, and soils still remain
contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
