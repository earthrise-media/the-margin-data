NPL Site Narrative for United Nuclear
Corp.
 
UNITED NUCLEAR CORP.
Church Rock, New Mexico
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : United Nuclear Corp. has operated a uranium mill on a 640-acre
site near Church Rock, New Mexico (approximately 17 miles northeast of Gallup) since May 1977. Tailings
from the mill are deposited in a large impoundment on-site. A break in the tailings dam in 1979 released
93 million gallons of tailings fluid to the Rio Puerco River. Subsequently, seepage from the impoundment
contaminated the Upper Gallup aquifer in the vicinity of the pond.
 
Status (July 1983) : New Mexico is requiring the company to address ground water contamination through
a Ground Water Discharge Plan. For the State to approve the plan, it must include monitoring of ground
water around the site, a program to control the migration of contaminants, and neutralization of the
contents of the impoundment. The plan has not been approved as yet.
