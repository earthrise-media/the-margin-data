Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Roto-Finish Co., Inc., operates a plant on a 7.5-acre site
in Kalamazoo, Kalamazoo County, Michigan. The plant produces equipment and materials to debur
castings, mechanical parts, and similar objects. In its operations, Roto-Finish uses 4,4'-methylene-bis
(2-chloroaniline), a curing agent for plastic. This chemical, commonly called MOCA, is a suspected
carcinogen, according to the State. Three lagoons on the site were used to hold over 83,000 gallons of
sludge containing heavy metals and MOCA. The company has excavated the lagoons.
 
Ground water at and near the site is contaminated with heavy metals, according to analyses conducted by
the State. The cities of Kalamazoo (population 80,000) and Portage (population 25,000) obtain drinking
water from wells within 3 miles of the site, as do a small number of private homes.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The site owner has conducted a cleanup operation and implemented a ground
water monitoring program. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources is reviewing the ground water
monitoring program.
