WEST VIRGINIA ORDNANCE (USARMY)
Point Pleasant, West Virginia
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The West Virginia Ordnance Site in Point Pleasant, Mason County,
West Virginia, was originally an 8,000-acre ordnance works run by the U.S. Army during World War
II. Presently, the State owns and operates the land as the McClintic Wildlife Refuge, open for public
hunting and fishing. Portions of the site that contain buried lines associated with the manufacturing of
trinitrotoluene (TNT) may be filled partially with crystalline TNT. Surface water (Pond 13) is contaminated
with dinitrotoluene (DNT), a chemical precursor of TNT.
 
This is the top priority site in West Virginia.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. Initial remedial measures recommended
for this site include posting and fencing of open manholes leading to the buried lines and fencing of Pond
13.
