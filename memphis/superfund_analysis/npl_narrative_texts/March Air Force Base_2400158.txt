NPL Site Narrative for March Air Force

MARCH AIR FORCE BASE
Riverside, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (July 14, 1989) : March Air Force Base (MAFB) covers approximately 7,000 acres
near Riverside in the Moreno Valley in Riverside County, California. MAFB is adjacent to light industrial,
agricultural, and residential areas. Established in 1918 as the Alessandro Aviation Field, MAFB has served
as a training base and refueling operations base. Industrial operations (including aircraft maintenance and
repair) involved use of solvents and disposal of solvent wastes.
 
MAFB is participating in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), established in 1978. Under this
program, the Department of Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination from
hazardous materials. As part of IRP, the Air Force investigated 28 potentially contaminated disposal areas.
MAFB Well No. 1 on-base was found to be contaminated with trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and
cis-1,2-dichloroethylene at levels that exceed State drinking water standards. It was taken out of service.
Soils on the base are contaminated with toluene and benzene. An estimated 11,600 people obtain drinking
water from municipal wells within 3 miles of hazardous substances on MAFB.
 
The Air Force is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the base and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
Status (November 21, 1989) : Field work continues on the RI/FS.
