NPL Site Narrative for Wells G&H
 
WELLS G&H
Woburn, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Wells G & H Site covers about 500 acres in East Central
Woburn, Massachusetts. Between 1964 and 1979, the wells provided approximately 25 percent of the
drinking water for the town, primarily 25 homes and businesses in the southeastern portion. In 1979, the
State closed the wells after detecting four chlorinated solvents in the water. The concentration of total
volatile organics was approximately 500 parts per billion. In 1980, EPA began preliminary assessments
of several industries in the area that may have affected Wells G & H. The investigation, later expanded to
include an evaluation of the geology and ground water quality of North and East Woburn, was completed in
June 1982.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA has issued three orders against potentially responsible parties under Section
3013 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The orders require the companies to
conduct a hydrogeological investigation of their properties. EPA has also sent 15 letters (under Section
3007 of RCRA) to other companies within the study area requesting detailed information about their use of
hazardous materials.
 
EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine
the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
