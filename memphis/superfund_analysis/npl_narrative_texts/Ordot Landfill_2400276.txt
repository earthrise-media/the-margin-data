NPL Site Narrative for Ordot Landfill
 
ORDOT LANDFILL
Ordot, Guam
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Ordot Landfill, in Ordot, Guam, has been in use over 40 years,
mostly as an open dump. There are no accurate records of what was dumped. The current site occupies
47 acres, and plans call for possible expansion to a total of 74 acres. Surface water from the site drains
into the Pago River, which discharges into Pago Bay. Direct human contact and contamination of marine
life used for food are of concern.
 
This is the top priority site in Guam.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1982, EPA approved $75,000 for studies of four sites -- Ordot Landfill, PCB
Wastes, PCB Warehouse, and Taputimu Farm -- located on islands of the Insular Territories. Another
$65,000 was added in November 1982. The funds are for two separate projects. One is to review and
compile existing data for the Ordot Landfill, where ground water and surface water may be threatened
by hazardous wastes mixed in with municipal wastes. The second is for the other three sites, where
wastes are containerized. The funds are for a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of
contamination at each site and a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is
scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983. The next step, if approved, would be to select the
cost-effective remedy and begin design activities. In January 1983, EPA awarded $10,000 to the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers for technical assistance to the project.
