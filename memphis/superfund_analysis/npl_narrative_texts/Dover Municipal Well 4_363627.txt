Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Town of Dover Water Commission owns and operates

Status (July 1983) : No source has thus far been linked to the contamination. The State is actively
investigating possible sources and is reviewing a hydrogeological study submitted by a private party. The
Dover Water Commission has been authorized to spend $45,000 over a 2-year period to identify possible
sources and has engaged a consultant to assist in the work.
