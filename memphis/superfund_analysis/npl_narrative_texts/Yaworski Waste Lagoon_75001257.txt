NPL Site Narrative for Yaworski Waste
Lagoon
 
YAWORSKI WASTE LAGOON
Canterbury, Connecticut
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Yaworski Waste Lagoon occupies 340 acres in the Town of
Canterbury, Connecticut. The lagoon, which is surrounded by a 6- to 9-foot dike, measures 700 feet by 400
feet and is 12 feet deep. The site is bordered on three sides by the Quinnibaug River. The lagoon is from
20 to 45 feet from the Quinnibaug. From about 1948 to 1973, drummed material and bulk wastes (including
textile dyes, solvents, resins, acids, caustics, still bottoms, and solvent-soaked rags) were accepted.
Periodically, wastes were burned to reduce the volume in the lagoon. In August 1973, the State issued
an order to close the lagoon due to organic odors. In May 1980, EPA detected methyl ethyl ketone, ethyl
benzene, toluene, and xylene in the lagoon. The State then ordered the owner to study the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : The owner is implementing a site closure plan, which the State approved. As of May
31, 1983, approximately 90 percent of the lagoon had been filled in. When the filling is complete, the
lagoon will be capped with clean dirt.
 
EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full
extent of cleanup required at the site. It is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983.
