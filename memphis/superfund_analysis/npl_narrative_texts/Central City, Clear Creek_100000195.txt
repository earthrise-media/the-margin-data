NPL Site Narrative for Central City-Clear
Creek
 
CENTRAL CITY-CLEAR CREEK
Idaho Springs, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Central City-Clear Creek Site is in Gilpin County in north central
Colorado. It consists of a limited number of abandoned gold mines near Central City and the Argo Tunnel
in Idaho Springs. Completed in 1904, the 4-mile tunnel drains ground water from 30 or more inactive
mines. Acid drainage containing heavy metals (cadmium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, and zinc)
flows from the mines near Central City and the tunnel into Clear Creek, an important source of industrial,
recreational, agricultural, and drinking water. In May 1980, a large discharge ("blow-out") from the tunnel
affected downstream users. Wells supplying drinking water are also contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA plans to spend about $75,000 to conduct (1) a remedial investigation to
determine the quality, quantity, and seasonal variations of flows from the mines and tunnel and (2)
a feasibility study to identify alternatives for treating or preventing the continuous discharge and for
preventing blow-outs. The work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 1985.
