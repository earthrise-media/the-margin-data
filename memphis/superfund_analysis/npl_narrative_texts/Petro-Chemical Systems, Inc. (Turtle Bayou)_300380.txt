covers 312 acres approximately 7 miles north of Interstate 10 in Liberty County, Texas. In 1971, Liberty
Trash Service and French, Ltd. delivered waste oils and at least 4,000 cubic yards of other petrochemical
sludges to the site. Additional materials were applied as road oil to the dirt road in the vicinity of the site.
In 1971, Petro-Chemical Systems, Inc., was issued a permit by the State to dispose of waste at the site.
Subsequently, a court injunction negated the authority of the permit. In 1974, the permit was revoked.
 
Drinking water for about 200 people in this rural area comes from 51 shallow wells approximately 25 feet
deep.

chemicals.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State is planning a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. The State's contractor submitted a workplan, which the State and EPA
approved on July 22, 1985. Field work for the off-site portion of the site is underway.
