NPL Site Narrative for Tar Creek (Ottawa
County)
 
TAR CREEK (OTTAWA COUNTY)
Ottawa County, Oklahoma
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Tar Creek Site, near Picher, in Ottawa County, Oklahoma,
covers 40 square miles. It is a portion of the Tri-State Mining District, which covers 100 square miles
and extends into Missouri and Kansas. The area produced significant quantities of iron and zinc in the
1920s and 1930s. When major mining operations ceased in the early 1970s, ground water accumulated
in the mines. In 1979, acid mine water with high concentrations of heavy metals began to discharge to the
surface, contaminating surface water. This problem, along with the potential for contaminating the drinking
water aquifer under the mining area, prompted the U.S. Geological Survey and the State to investigate the
site. In 1981, the State declared the site its number one pollution problem.
 
Status (July 1983) : In June 1982, EPA awarded a $435,368 Cooperative Agreement to Oklahoma for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of
1983.
