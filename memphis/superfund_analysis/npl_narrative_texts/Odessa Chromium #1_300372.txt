NPL Site Narrative for Odessa Chromium
#1
 
ODESSA CHROMIUM #1
Odessa, Texas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Odessa Chromium #1 Site is a 20-acre portion of an
aquifer near 44th Street and Brazos Avenue in Odessa, Ector County, Texas. An abandoned facility at 44th
and Brazos has been operated in the past by several metal-plating companies. The aquifer is the source of
water for about 20 people who live outside the city limits and do not have access to the city water system.
Of 32 private domestic wells, 7 have concentrations of hexavalent chromium in excess of the drinking
water standard, according to tests conducted by the State.
 
There are approximately 200 private wells within 0.5 mile of the site and 29 municipal wells within 3 miles
of the site. Water from the municipal wells is blended with surface water during the summer for the Odessa
water supply.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State is conducting a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. The State hired a contractor in June 1985. Field work started in September
1985 and was completed in January 1986. Of the 200 wells sampled during the investigation, 10 exceeded
drinking water standards for hexavalent chromium. The State is developing a plan for providing an
alternate drinking water supply for the persons affected.
