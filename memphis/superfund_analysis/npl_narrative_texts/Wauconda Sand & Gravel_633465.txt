NPL Site Narrative for Wauconda Sand &
Gravel
 
WAUCONDA SAND & GRAVEL
Wauconda, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Wauconda Sand & Gravel Site covers 80 acres in Lake County,
Illinois, about 2 miles north of Wauconda and 3 miles east of Island Lake. The site, originally a sand and
gravel pit, accepted wastes from 1950 to 1978, when it was closed and covered. The northern two-thirds
of the site was filled prior to the State's landfill regulations and was never permitted. A 9-acre portion
in the southern third of the site was permitted to accept general refuse. Leachate from the landfill has
contaminated both ground water and surface water in the vicinity. Samples from monitoring and private
wells reveal low levels of contaminants at this time, including ammonia, boron, chloride, iron, phenols,
PCBs, and 2,4-dimethylphenol. Leachate contaminated by low levels of PCBs has also been detected
entering Mutton Creek north of the landfill.
 
Status (July 1983) : In June 1983, EPA started a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine
the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is
scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 1984.
