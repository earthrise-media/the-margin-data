NPL Site Narrative for Croydon TCE
 
CROYDON TCE
Croydon, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Croydon Trichloroethylene (TCE) Site involves
the presence of TCE and other volatile organic compounds in ground water and surface water in an
industrialized area of Croydon, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. EPA detected contamination in monitoring
wells, private wells, and the West and East Branches of Hog Run near where they meet. Hog Run flows
into the Delaware River, which reverses its flow in the area because of tidal influences. About 18,000
people depend on water from the Delaware River within 3 miles upstream of the site for drinking water.
About 200 people depend on shallow private wells within 3 miles.
 
To date, no source of the contamination has been positively identified. However, data collected by EPA in
April 1985 have identified areas in need of additional investigation.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is currently investigating the source of the contamination by surveying local
industries, contacting citizens, and reviewing State/county files.
