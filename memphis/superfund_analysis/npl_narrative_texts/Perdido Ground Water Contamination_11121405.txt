NPL Site Narrative for Perdido Ground
Water Contamination
 
PERDIDO GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Perdido, Alabama
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Perdido Ground Water Contamination Site covers about
125 acres in Perdido, Baldwin County, Alabama. No public drinking water is available. In November
1981, Perdido residents began to complain to the State that the water from their wells tasted bad. In
February 1982, the State detected benzene in excess of the Federal drinking water standards in several
residential wells. Additional sampling confirmed benzene in eight wells. In September 1982, health officials
announced that ground water in Perdido was harmful to human health and recommended that people
stop drinking their well water if they lived within 1 mile of a 1965 train derailment in which benzene and
other chemicals were spilled. The county then arranged for delivery of two mobile drinking water tanks to
Perdido.
 
Status (July 1983) : In February 1983, the railroad agreed to fund installation of an alternate water supply
for the community.
 
The State, with help from EPA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, is investigating the ground water
contamination problem. In addition, EPA is preparing a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
