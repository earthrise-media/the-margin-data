NPL Site Narrative for Leonard Chemical
Co., Inc.
 
LEONARD CHEMICAL CO., INC.
Rock Hill, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Leonard Chemical Co., Inc., stored wastes and disposed of
process residues (mainly distillation bottoms and chemical wastes) on a 7-acre site in Rock Hill, York
County, South Carolina. About 3,400 drums and 11,500 gallons of various chemical wastes in surface
tanks were stored on the site. Numerous spills and leaks have occurred, threatening ground water. The
State ordered Leonard Chemical to install three monitoring wells at the site. The company's data indicate
low levels of organic contamination in a shallow aquifer. In May 1983, a group of generators, in response
to a State Consent Order, retained a contractor to remove surface wastes from the site. The operation
was completed in June 1983. However, due to low estimates in the generators' bid proposal, not all of the
surface wastes were removed.
 
Status (June 1984) : The generators of wastes at the site have voluntarily moved more than 80 percent of
the waste. The State is negotiating a Consent Order to complete the cleanup.
