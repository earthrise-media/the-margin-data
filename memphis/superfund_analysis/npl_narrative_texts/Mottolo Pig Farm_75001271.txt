NPL Site Narrative for Mottolo Pig Farm
 
MOTTOLO PIG FARM
Raymond, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : The Mottolo Pig Farm is in an undeveloped wooded area of
approximately 50 acres on Blueberry Hill Road in Raymond, Rockingham County, New Hampshire. Over a
period of 3 to 4 years ending in 1979, approximately 1,000 barrels of hazardous materials were buried on a
0.25-acre fill area on the abandoned pig farm. Among the materials were carbon tetrachloride, chloroform,
ethylbenzene, methyl ethyl ketone, and toluene.
 
According to tests conducted by a consultant to the State, on-site soil and ground water are contaminated
with lead. An estimated 1,600 people depend on ground water within 3 miles of the site as a source of
drinking water. Downhill from the site is a small stream that is a tributary to the Exeter River. The town of
Exeter draws its municipal water from the river.
 
From September 8 through December 5, 1980, under Section 311(k) of the Clean Water Act, EPA
used emergency funds to excavate and store drums on-site. From November 30, 1981 to January 22,
1982, EPA used CERCLA emergency funds to remove drums from the site, thereby preventing further
contamination of the soil and ground water. Under CERCLA Section 107, EPA is seeking to recover the
costs of the 1980 action from the owner and several generators of wastes at the site. The State is also
seeking to recover costs.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
