NPL Site Narrative for Summitville Mine
 
SUMMITVILLE MINE
Rio Grande County, Colorado
 
 
Summitville Mine is located in the San Juan Mountains near Del Norte in Rio Grande County, Colorado.
The 1,400-acre site is extremely remote at an elevation of more than 11,000 feet, making the site
accessible by vehicle only in the summer months.
 
Mining began at Summitville in the late 1800s. The most recent operator, Summitville Consolidated Mining
Corp., Inc. (SCMCI), began open pit mining and recovering gold by cyanide heap leaching in 1986.
 
SCMCI originally designed the mining operation as a non-discharging waste water facility. Problems with
discharges eventually required SCMCI to obtain a NPDES permit from the State to operate a waste water
treatment plant.
 
Several releases of water contaminated with cyanide and metals have been documented at the mine.
The State has issued Notices of Violation to SCMCI for unpermitted releases of contaminated water. Fish
kills have been reported from Wightman Fork downstream to Terrace Reservoir, approximately 20 miles
downstream from the mine site.
 
Because SCMCI has declared bankruptcy, EPA is maintaining the site using CERCLA emergency funds
to ensure that 150 million gallons of water contaminated with cyanide and metals are not released into
Wightman Fork. Wightman Fork flows into the Alamosa River 5 miles downstream.
