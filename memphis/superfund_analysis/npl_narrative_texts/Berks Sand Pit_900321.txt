NPL Site Narrative for Berks Sand Pit
 
BERKS SAND PIT
Longswamp Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Berks Sand Pit covers 0.5 acre in Longswamp Township
near the Village of Huffs Church in Berks County, Pennsylvania. The privately-owned sand pit was used
for disposal of chemical waste before it was filled in and regraded. Nearby residential wells serving three
homes have been severely contaminated with organic compounds such as trichloroethane and 1,2-
dichloroethane, as well as some metals, according to tests conducted by EPA and the State. Contaminated
ground water is discharging into the headwaters of the north branch of the Perkiomen Creek, which is
a major public water source for the Philadelphia Suburban Water Co. and is also used for recreational
fishing.
 
In April 1983, EPA allocated $782,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to provide temporary drinking water to
nearby residents, install a collection and treatment system, and remove contaminated material from the pit.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State and EPA have signed a Cooperative Agreement for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. Also, EPA will assess the site to determine if any additional immediate
response is necessary.
