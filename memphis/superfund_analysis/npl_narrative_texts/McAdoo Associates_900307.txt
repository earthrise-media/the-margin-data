NPL Site Narrative for McAdoo Associates
 
MCADOO ASSOCIATES
McAdoo Borough, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The McAdoo Associates Site consists of two areas approximately
1.3 miles apart. One, in the Borough of McAdoo, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, covers less than 0.2
acre. The other, in Kline Township, covers 10 acres. Waste was stored at the site between May 1978
until April 1979, when Pennsylvania revoked McAdoo's permit. Contamination of ground water, surface
water, and air has been documented. The McAdoo Borough facility has four underground tanks containing
hazardous substances. The Kline Township area, used as a metal reclamation/incineration facility, consists
of approximately 7,000 drums and six above-ground tanks.
 
This is the top priority site in Pennsylvania.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1982, EPA approved $100,000 for a remedial investigation of soil and ground
water to determine the type and extent of contamination at the Kline Township area. In September 1982,
the owners of the site and generators responsible for the wastes voluntarily removed all surface waste. In
January 1983, EPA signed a $350,000 Superfund State Contract to complete the remedial investigation
and to start a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action at Kline. The work is scheduled to
be completed in the first quarter of 1984.
