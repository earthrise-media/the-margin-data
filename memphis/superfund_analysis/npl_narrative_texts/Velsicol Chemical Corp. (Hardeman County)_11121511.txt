NPL Site Narrative for Velsicol Chemical
Corp. (Hardeman County)
 
VELSICOL CHEMICAL CORP. (HARDEMAN COUNTY)
Toone, Tennessee
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Velsicol Chemical Corp.'s Hardeman County Dump, near
Toone, Tennessee, accepted the company's process wastes in the 1960s and 1970s. Detection of
organic contaminants in local wells in 1978 resulted in extensive sampling and geologic and hydrological
assessments. Velsicol capped the site and agreed to monitor until December 1983 to determine the
effectiveness of the action.
 
Status (July 1983) : When the monitoring period ends, Velsicol, the State, and EPA will review the
effectiveness of the cap. Any additional measures to control the site will be discussed at that time, as well
as the possible need for decontaminating area ground water.
