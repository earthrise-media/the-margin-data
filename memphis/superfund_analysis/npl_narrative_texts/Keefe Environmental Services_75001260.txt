KEEFE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES
Epping, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Keefe Environmental Services (KES), Inc., started operating a
waste bulking and transfer station on a 5-acre site in Epping, New Hampshire, in 1978. In 1979, during
peak operation, wastes stored at the site included over 6,000 drums, bulk storage containers, pails, and
a 750,000-gallon waste storage lagoon. In 1980, Epping and the State started legal action against the
company. KES declared voluntary bankruptcy in 1981, leaving on the site flammable chlorinated and other
organic chemicals, heavy-metal and paint sludges, laboratory wastes, and waste oils. Air, soil, and ground
water are contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : Between March 1981 and September 1982, using $1.0 million in CERCLA emergency
funds, EPA stabilized drums and tanks, pumped down the lagoon three times to avoid breaching of the
dike, and removed explosive and shock-sensitive materials. During this time, the State succeeded in
getting the owner and some generators to remove some drums.
 
In September 1982, EPA approved $100,000 for design of a plan to remove the remaining drums. In
September, EPA also awarded a $1,709,945 Cooperative Agreement to New Hampshire for (1) two
initial remedial measures--fencing of the site and removal of the remaining drums and (2) completion
of a remedial investigation and feasibility study to identify alternatives for cleanup of the waste lagoon,
contaminated soils, suspected buried drums, and any contamination of ground water.
 
EPA has identified other parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site and is seeking
their cooperation in the cleanup.
