NPL Site Narrative for Byron Salvage Yard
 
BYRON SALVAGE YARD
Byron, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Byron Salvage Yard occupies 10 acres just east of Byron,
Illinois, in the 2,200-acre drainage basin of Woodland Creek. The flow of the creek is such that any
leachate from the site drains into the creek and contaminates the ground water below. In 1974, the State
filed a complaint charging the owners of Byron Salvage Yard with water pollution. The State continued to
monitor in and around the yard until the end of 1981. The results revealed that cyanide-containing plating
waste had been sprayed onto the roads in and around the salvage yard, and that plating wastes and other
wastes, either bulk or in containers, had been dumped and buried in the yard. These activities resulted in
high concentrations of cyanide and toxic metals in soils, surface water, and ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1983, EPA signed a $248,393 Cooperative Agreement with Illinois for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of
1984.
