KEARSARGE METALLURGICAL CORP.
Conway, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Kearsarge Metallurgical Corp. (proposed for listing as Kearsarge
Metallurgical Corp.) produced cast metal parts for industry on a 5-acre site in Conway, New Hampshire,
from 1964 until it went out of business in January 1982. It appears that over 5 years of operation, the
owner discharged hazardous materials into the ground at the rear of the facility. Sampling by the State
detected 1,1,1-trichloroethane, toluene, chromium, and cadmium in ground water and chlorinated solvents
in surface water near the facility. The degree of contamination is not known at this time.
 
Indian Head Bank North (security bank for the facility) arranged for removal of 300 drums and quantities of
contaminated soil and for installation of eight monitoring wells around the site.
 
The State filed a Civil Action in Superior Court, Carroll County, on April 23, 1983, asking for civil penalties
for disposal of hazardous waste and ordering the owner to conduct a hydrogeological study.
 
Status (June 1984) : The owner has declared bankruptcy. The State is tentatively planning to complete a
limited hydrogeologic investigation during the summer of 1984.
