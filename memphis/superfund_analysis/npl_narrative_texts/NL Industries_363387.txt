NPL Site Narrative for NL Industries
 
NL INDUSTRIES
Pedricktown, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The NL Industries landfill covers 14 acres in a rural area in
Pedricktown, Salem County, New Jersey. The company recovers lead from spent automotive batteries
and separates the plastic from the rubber casings. After the rubber and plastic are separated, the plastic is
reprocessed and the rubber is placed in the landfill, which is lined but not capped.
 
As a result of improper storage of batteries on the site and other factors relating to their processing, ground
water, surface water, and soils are extensively contaminated with various heavy metals. Also on-site is
a marsh area (which is heavily contaminated with lead) and Oldmans Creek, a tributary to the Delaware
River.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is pursuing cleanup through enforcement action.
