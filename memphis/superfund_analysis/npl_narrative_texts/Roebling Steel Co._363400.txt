Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Roebling Steel Co. produced steel on a site adjacent to the
Delaware River in Florence, New Jersey. Two unlined lagoons are on the site, and there is evidence of
dumping and spillage. The lagoons, estimated to be 3 feet deep, contain heavy metals. Drums may also
have been buried at the site. Run-off may have contaminated the river. The water table in the area is only
about 10 feet below the surface. Homes in Roebling and much of the surrounding area rely on ground
water for their drinking water.
