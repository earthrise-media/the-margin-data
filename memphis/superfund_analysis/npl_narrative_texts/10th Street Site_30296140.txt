NPL Site Narrative for 10th Street Site
 
10TH STREET SITE
Columbus, Nebraska
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : The 10th Street Site consists of four contaminated municipal
water supply wells and two areas of soil contamination in the City of Columbus, Platte County, Nebraska.
The site occupies about 18 acres in downtown Columbus on the north bank of the Loup River. The site
boundary is currently delineated by Columbus Municipal Wells #1, 2, 4, and 11 and by four soil samples.
 
These four municipal wells were sampled by the Nebraska Department of Health in June 1984 and
December 1988 and by EPA in April 1987, September 1987, and February 1988. The results show from
2.0 parts per billion (ppb) to 29.0 ppb of 1,1,2-trichloroethylene. Tetrachloroethylene was detected in Wells
#2 and #4 at levels ranging from 2.0 ppb to 24.7 ppb. A soil-gas survey conducted in May 1988 by EPA
delineated a ground water plume with a point source located in a city parking lot (formerly a scrap metal
yard) about 1,000 feet east of Well #1. Potential sources of the soil contamination are a dry cleaning facility
behind the lot and a laundromat 1,400 feet southwest of the lot. Both facilities are or once were identified
as small quantity generators of tetrachloroethylene under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act. Both facilities are within 1,000 feet of the contaminated wells.
 
The municipal wells and private wells within 3 miles of the site provide drinking water to an estimated
19,300 people; 48 irrigation wells are also in use. All wells tap the surficial aquifer consisting of alluvial
sands and gravels; the water table is at a depth between 12.4 and 30 feet.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : During the summer of 1990, EPA will start a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action.
