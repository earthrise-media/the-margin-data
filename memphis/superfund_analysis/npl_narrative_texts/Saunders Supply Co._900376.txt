NPL Site Narrative for Saunders Supply
Co.
 
SAUNDERS SUPPLY CO.
Chuckatuck, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : Saunders Supply Co. has treated wood on a
site in Chuckatuck, Suffolk County, Virginia, since 1964. From 1964 to 1984, the facility used a
pentachlorophenol/No.2 Fuel Oil mixture as a wood preservative. Chromated copper arsenate was also
used starting in 1974 and is still in use. The spent pentachlorophenol/oil mixture was burned in an unlined
pit, which resulted in the generation of dioxin compounds.
 
Tests conducted by EPA in November 1984 detected elevated levels of chromium in Godwin's Mill
Pond Reservoir, a source of drinking water for over 30,000 people in Suffolk, Virginia. A fresh water
wetland is within 1,000 feet downstream of the point where chromium was found. The tests also found
pentachlorophenol, lead, chromium, and arsenic in the Columbia Aquifer, which supplies private wells
within 3 miles of the site that served over 1,990 people. The nearest well is approximately 1,900 feet from
the site.
 
In 1983, the company excavated some contaminated soil and transported it to an EPA-regulated landfill. A
recovery well was drilled, and contaminated ground water is pumped out of the well and recycled back into
a treatment system.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. Seven monitoring
wells have been installed. All sampling except ground water has been completed.
