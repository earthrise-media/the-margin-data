NPL Site Narrative for Florence Land
Recontouring, Inc., Landfill
 
FLORENCE LAND RECONTOURING, INC., LANDFILL
Florence Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Florence Land Recontouring, Inc., Landfill covers 39 acres
in Florence Township, Burlington County, New Jersey. It was licensed by the State as a municipal waste
landfill. In 1981, it ceased operations in response to a 1980 Administrative Order issued by the State
denying an application to expand and requiring it to close.
 
On-site wells are contaminated with hazardous substances, including toluene, according to analyses
conducted by the State. The landfill has a history of water-ponding problems. In 1979, the State issued a
final Consent Order requiring that the owner rehabilitate the dikes, cover, and leachate collection system.
The operator has been unable to meet the requirements of the order, and standing water is routinely found
on the site.
 
The area, largely rural/agricultural, is highly dependent on ground water for drinking water -- 16 public wells
and over 1,800 private wells are within 3 miles of the landfill. Development of a 1,500-home complex is
proposed within 0.5 mile of the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
