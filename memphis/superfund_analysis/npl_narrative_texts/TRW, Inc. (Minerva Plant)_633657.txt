NPL Site Narrative for TRW, Inc. (Minerva
Plant)
 
TRW, INC. (MINERVA PLANT)
Minerva, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The TRW, Inc., Site covers 54 acres in Minerva, Stark
County, Ohio. The Minerva plant is adjacent to State Road 183, approximately 1.3 miles northeast of the
intersection of Route 183 and U.S. Route 30. TRW purchased the initial property in 1954 and expanded
twice by adding adjacent properties. Farmland lies to the north and east of the site. The TRW property
extends south to Sandy Creek, which is used for recreational activities.
 
The plant conducts metal-casting operations. Until 1976, PCBs were used as working fluids in diffusion
pumps. Spent PCBs were stored in drums on the back pad of the plant and apparently leaked into the
drainage ditch adjacent to the pad. Waste wash water and spent casting wax, which may have come into
contact with the PCBs, were discarded into a ditch that flowed to the south to a pond. Volatile organic
chemicals (trichloroethylene before 1972 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane after 1972) were used as degreasers,
and spent degreasers were discharged to the ditch.
 
Ground water on the site is contaminated with PCBs, trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1-
dichloroethane, and 1,1-dichloroethylene, according to analyses conducted by a consultant to TRW.
 
Minerva city wells are located approximately 1 mile southwest and downgradient of the TRW building, west
of Sandy Creek, and south of Route 30. The wells draw water at 80 to 120 feet from a sand and gravel
aquifer, the same aquifer that underlies TRW property. The wells serve 4,560 people. Within 3 miles of the
site are shallow residential wells serving approximately 114 persons in Minerva, 125 persons in Pekin, 400
persons in East Rochester, and 200 persons in Bayard. The nearest residential well is 925 feet from the
TRW plant.
 
In 1985, TRW hooked up 17 homes in Old Park to the City of Minerva municipal water supply system.
 
In June 1985, the State issued an Administrative Order on Consent involving contaminated soil, sediments,
and waxes. In November 1985, TRW completed placing the materials in an on-site secure disposal cell. In
April 1986, the State issued an Administrative Order covering cleanup of ground water.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : In November 1986, TRW started operating a system that pumps contaminated
ground water to the surface, treats it with an air stripper, and discharges the treated water to Sandy Creek.
