GENERAL MOTORS (CENTRAL FOUNDRY DIVISION)
Massena, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The General Motors (Central Foundry Division) Site is a 165-
acre aluminum casting facility on the St. Lawrence River, in Massena, St. Lawrence County, New York.
The site contains two areas that have received an estimated 30,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated
sludges generated from recycling of hydraulic oil formerly used in the plant's machinery. A portion
of the waste lies below the water table. An additional 9,000 gallons of contaminated oil are stored in
an abandoned pump house. Analyses by the State indicate that ground water and surface water are
contaminated on the site. Run-off is toward the Raquette River, St. Lawrence River, and the St. Regis
Indian Reservation; all are about 1,000 feet from the site. The company's response to an information
request letter indicates there are other areas of concern at the facility.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA and the State are planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine
the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
