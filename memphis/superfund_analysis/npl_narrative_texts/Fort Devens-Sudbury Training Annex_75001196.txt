NPL Site Narrative for Fort Devens-
Sudbury Training Annex
 
FORT DEVENS-SUDBURY TRAINING ANNEX
Sudbury, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at proposal (July 14, 1989) : The Sudbury Training Annex to Fort Devens occupies
approximately 4 square miles within Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The annex includes portions
of the towns of Sudbury, Maynard, Hudson, and Stow. The area around the base is mainly agricultural
interspersed with residential areas.
 
Established in the early 1940s as the Maynard Ammunition Depot, the installation became known as the
Maynard Ordnance Test Station after World War II. In the mid-1950s, the facility became known as the
U.S. Army Natick Research and Development Command and was used for troop training and disposal of
certain wastes from Natick Laboratory. Between 1980 and 1983, the area was transferred to Fort Devens
12 miles to the northeast. The primary mission of both installations is to train active duty personnel to
support various Army units. Fort Devens is also being proposed for the NPL at this time.
 
Sudbury Annex is participating in the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), established in 1978. Under
this program, the Department of Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination from
hazardous materials. The Army has identified a number of potentially contaminated areas, including
11 containing explosive residues, chemical laboratory wastes, oil lubricants, and other toxic materials.
According to a 1986 IRP report, two monitoring wells downgradient of two of the areas are contaminated
with 1,1,1-trichloroethane, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, and benzene. The two areas, which are separated by
an unnamed tributary to the Assabet River, are Waste Area A7 (a 20-acre gravel pit used from the 1940s
to 1980s as a laboratory dump, general dump, and burning ground) and Waste Area A9 (a 7-acre area
used since the 1950s for fire training by the State). An estimated 35,700 people obtain drinking water from
public and private wells within 3 miles of the waste areas. A private well is 1,600 feet from the waste areas.
 
White Pond, which provides water to 12,000 residents of Maynard, is within 3 miles downstream of Waste
Area A5, a 70-square-foot pit where laboratory solvents were buried during 1973-79. A fresh water wetland
is within 600 feet of the pond.
 
In June 1985, 100-200 gallons of PCB-containing oil spilled from an out-of-service transformer in a remote
abandoned area of Sudbury Training Annex. The Army removed 300 gallons of Aroclor 1260 and about 70
tons of PCB-contaminated soil to a facility regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA).
 
In July 1985, four electrical transformer units were found in a remote section of the annex. Bullet holes and
dents were obvious in one unit, which permitted PCB-containing fluids to escape. The Army removed the
transformers and some contaminated soil to a facility regulated under TSCA.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : EPA is reviewing information on the site in preparation for negotiations in
1990 with the Army for an Interagency Agreement under CERCLA Section 120 covering further studies
and remedial activities.
