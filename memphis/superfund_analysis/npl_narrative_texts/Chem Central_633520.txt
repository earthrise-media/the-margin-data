NPL Site Narrative for Chem Central
 
CHEM CENTRAL
Wyoming Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Chem Central Site covers 5 acres in Wyoming Township,
Kent County, Michigan. In 1977, the State detected high concentrations of PCBs, heavy metals,
phthalates, oils, and organic compounds in oily sediments in a ditch near the site. Despite repeated
draining, contaminants continue to leach into the ditch, which discharges to Cle Drain, a tributary of Plaster
Creek. Ground water studies conducted by the State have traced the contamination to Chem Central
(formerly Wolverine Solvents), a chemical distribution facility. The ditch area has been fenced and warning
signs posted.
 
In 1980, the State filed suit seeking a permanent injunction to halt Chem Central's discharges to the ground
and dry wells and to stop contaminating ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through a State enforcement
action.
