NPL Site Narrative for Outboard Marine
Corp.
 
OUTBOARD MARINE CORP.
Waukegan, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : From 1959 to 1971, the Johnson Motors Division of Outboard
Marine Corp. (OMC) in Waukegan, Illinois, purchased about 9 million pounds of PCBs. The material
was used in aluminum die cast machines, which routinely leaked. In 1976, the company was found to
be discharging PCBs into the Waukegan Harbor and the North Ditch; both feed into Lake Michigan. This
finding was of great concern because a number of Lake Michigan fish species contain PCBs in quantities
exceeding Food and Drug Administration guidelines. EPA and the State issued administrative orders
requiring that the company take certain steps to eliminate discharges of PCBs. Although those steps were
taken and discharges significantly reduced, a great deal of PCBs had been released to the environment.
 
In 1976, EPA began studies to determine the nature and extent of the PCB problem. The studies show
that PCBs are distributed throughout the sediments of Waukegan Harbor, with the highest concentrations
in Slip 3. About 11,000 cubic yards are at a concentration of 500 parts per million (ppm) or more, about
50,000 cubic yards beyond 50 ppm, and substantially more greater than 10 ppm. In addition, the flowing
waters in the ditch annually carry sediments containing 11 pounds of PCBs into the lake. A parking lot next
to the lake shore is contaminated.
 
In 1978, with a special $1.5 million appropriation from Congress, EPA's Region V Office investigated the
extent of contamination and identified options for cleanup. In 1980, an additional $436,000, made available
under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, was used to
study the site.
 
Following a breakdown of negotiations between Illinois and OMC, the Department of Justice, on behalf of
EPA, filed a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief against parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site.
 
This is the top priority site in Illinois.
 
Status (July 1983) : In February 1983, EPA approved $100,000 to do a feasibility study, largely based
on existing data to identify alternatives for remedial action at the site. A decision on the final remedy is
scheduled for the third quarter of 1983.
