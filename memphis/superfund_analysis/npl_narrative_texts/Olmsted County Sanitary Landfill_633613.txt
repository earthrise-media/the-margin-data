NPL Site Narrative for Olmsted County
Sanitary Landfill
 
OLMSTED COUNTY SANITARY LANDFILL
Oronoco, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Olmsted County Sanitary Landfill covers 50 acres near
Oronoco in Olmsted County, Minnesota. The municipal landfill, which has been in operation since 1972,
has accepted industrial wastes. Monitoring wells contain solvents (methyl ethyl ketone, trichloroethylene,
tetrachloroethylene, and others) and cadmium, according to tests conducted by the State. Since the
aquifer is of dolomite/limestone, which is permeable, movement of contaminants is likely. Thus, nearby
wells serving 1,200 people are threatened. Leachate has been observed in run-off from the surface of the
landfill. An intermittent stream which runs through the site to the Zumbro River could carry contaminants
during heavy rains.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
