NPL Site Narrative for LaBounty Site
 
LABOUNTY SITE
Charles City, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The LaBounty site occupies 8.5 acres on the Cedar River
floodplain at the southern edge of Charles City, Iowa. From 1953 to 1977, Salsbury Laboratories, a
manufacturer of veterinary pharmaceuticals, disposed of 6.4 million cubic feet of arsenical sludge and
organic wastes on the site. Leachate from the site is contaminated with 36 chemicals, some containing
metals. Leachate-contaminated ground water discharges from a shallow aquifer into the Cedar River,
but the deeper aquifer is not presently contaminated. The river and the deeper aquifer combined supply
drinking water to more than 300,000 people, about 1/3 of Iowa's population.
 
In 1977, Iowa issued an administrative order that required the company to prevent run-off, cease
operations, and submit a plan for removal of wastes. EPA also issued an administrative order requiring the
company to take interim remedial measures. In response, the company installed a ground water monitoring
system, capped the site, and took measures to reroute and divert run-off.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State and EPA are evaluating monthly ground water and surface water monitoring
data to assess the effectiveness of the company's interim remedial measures and determine if additional
remedial action is necessary.
