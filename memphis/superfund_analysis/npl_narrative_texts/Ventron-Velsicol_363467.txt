NPL Site Narrative for Ventron/Velsicol
 
VENTRON/VELSICOL
Woodridge Borough, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Ventron/Velsicol Site was a chemical-processing
operation from before 1953 until it closed in 1974. The site is on 19 acres bordering Berry's Creek and the
Hackensack Meadowlands in Wood-Ridge Borough, Bergen County, New Jersey. The region is densely
populated and industrialized. Heavy metals are leaving the site in ground water and air, threatening
extensive wetlands and a very large population, according to the State. There is also a significant direct
contact hazard from wastes dumped on the ground.
 
The State filed suit in 1976 against the company seeking a judgment of liability and funds to clean up the
site. The Chancery Division found for the State in 1979. Following appeal by the defendants, the Appellate
Division found for the State in 1981. The case is now before the Supreme Court of New Jersey.
 
The State is considering various remedial actions; costs are expected to be at least $4 million.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
