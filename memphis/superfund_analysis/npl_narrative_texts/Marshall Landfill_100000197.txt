NPL Site Narrative for Marshall Landfill
 
MARSHALL LANDFILL
Boulder County, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Marshall Landfill covers 160 acres in Boulder County, Colorado. It
has been operated as a municipal waste landfill by several private parties since 1965. An 80-acre portion
was closed in 1974. Municipal waste and sewage sludge were dumped at both the active and inactive
areas, and industrial liquid wastes may have been disposed of in both.
 
Samples from wells and seeps indicate elevated levels of contaminants, including phenols, methylene
chloride, trichloroethylene, and diethyl phthalate in ground water beneath the site. Seepage from the base
of the landfill is also contaminated. The seeps drain into Community Ditch, which flows to a water treatment
facility operated by Louisville about 3 miles downstream from the landfill.
 
This is the top priority site in Colorado.
 
Status (July 1983) : Action to isolate Community Ditch from all contaminated surface water seeps is
presently planned, along with an investigation to determine the extent of contamination of ground water
beneath the landfill. Based on results of the study, further remedial actions will be determined. These
studies are scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of 1984.
