NPL Site Narrative for Gurley Pit
 
GURLEY PIT
Edmondson, Arkansas
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Gurley Pit covers 3.3 acres 1 mile north of Edmondson in
Crittenden County, Arkansas. Between 1970 and early 1976, the site, which was privately owned and
operated, was used for disposal of sludges from the refining of waste oil. The sludges are contaminated
with chromium and lead and low levels of PCPs. In 1978 and 1979, the pit overflowed into a nearby stream
after heavy rains. The State and EPA cleaned up the site under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act. Pit
overflow continued to be a potential threat to the area.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
