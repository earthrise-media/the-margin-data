NPL Site Narrative for Berks Landfill
 
BERKS LANDFILL
Spring Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Berks Landfill is in Spring Township, Berks County,
Pennsylvania. The site consists of two unlined landfills: an active 43-acre unit and an inactive 17-acre unit.
The owner started operating the now inactive unit in the 1960s. Starting in 1979, Stabatrol Corp. operated
within the unit, disposing of stabilized alkali sludges with approval of the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources (PA DER). In 1975, PA DER granted a permit to discharge treated leachate from
the landfill's leachate collection system into an adjacent stream. PA DER halted the discharges in 1979
because of violations of water quality standards. In 1980, PA DER suspended its approval for Stabatrol to
stabilize sludges due to inadequate storage methods, which stopped all operations on the 17-acre site.
 
The 43-acre active landfill received a solid waste permit from PA DER in May 1975 to accept municipal
refuse and demolition debris. A leachate collection system discharges to four surface impoundments (three
of which were unlined until 1986). The leachate is transported off-site to a treatment plant. A new owner
acquired the site in 1984. In 1986, PA DER temporarily closed the landfill. Final closure was completed in
1988.
 
Analyses conducted in 1985 by EPA and PA DER detected 1,2-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride,
trichloroethylene, benzene, and manganese in an on-site monitoring well and in a private well
downgradient of the site. An estimated 26,500 residents use private and public wells within 3 miles of the
site for drinking water.
 
The site is unfenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact with hazardous
substances in the impoundments.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is conducting a search to identify parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site and will then negotiate with them to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action.
