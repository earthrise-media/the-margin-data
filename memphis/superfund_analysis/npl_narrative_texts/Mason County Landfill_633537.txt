NPL Site Narrative for Mason County
Landfill
 
MASON COUNTY LANDFILL
Pere Marquette Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Mason County Landfill occupies 3 acres in Pere Marquette
Township, Mason County, Michigan, about 1 mile east of Lake Michigan. From late 1971 until August
1978, it was operated for the county by Acme Disposal. While in operation, the landfill received residential,
commercial, and industrial refuse, as well as liquid wastes and sludges. In 1979, it was covered with
2 feet of clay. After that, the site and adjacent land eroded and may have polluted ground water and
nearby Iris Creek. Ground water contaminants include pentachlorophenol, trichloroethylene, 1,2-trans-
dichloroethylene, and 1,1-dichloroethane. In late 1978, Acme Disposal was ordered to install additional
monitoring wells, analyze water samples, and survey the site. A Consent Order was subsequently issued
to cover the items that remained to be completed. In late 1981 and early 1982, residents filed two suits
against the county and Acme.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through an enforcement action
against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
