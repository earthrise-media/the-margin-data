NPL Site Narrative for H. Brown Co., Inc.
 
H. BROWN CO., INC.
Grand Rapids, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : H. Brown Co., Inc., owned and operated a facility for reclaiming
nonferrous metals on a 4-acre site in Grand Rapids, Kent County, Michigan, from 1961 through 1981 or
1982. The site lies within a 50-year floodplain of the Grand River.
 
The facility was used primarily to reclaim lead from wet-cell batteries. Between 1961 and late 1978,
approximately 457,000 gallons of sulfuric acid containing lead, cadmium, iron, and zinc were poured
directly onto the soil in an area covering 1,250 square feet.
 
The facility overlies a highly permeable glacial till and limestone bedrock. Therefore, there is a potential for
ground water contamination. Approximately 3,000 people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site as a
source of drinking water.
 
Grand River and Indian Creek are threatened by run-off from the site. During the summer, the Grand
Rapids Water Department blends water from the river with Lake Michigan water to serve 239,000
customers. The Grand River intake is 5,000 feet downstream of the site. The river and creek are used for
recreational activities.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
