NPL Site Narrative for Olean Well Field
 
OLEAN WELL FIELD
Olean, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Olean Well Field is within both the Town and City of Olean,
Cattaraugus County, New York. The 1-square-mile site contains three public water supply wells and
numerous private wells, in addition to municipal and industrial dumps. Excessive levels of trichloroethylene
(TCE) were discovered in public wells in late 1980. Several suspected sources of contamination have been
identified. Olean now gets its drinking water from a nearby well field and from surface water, which must be
treated in an aging filtration plant. Private wells continue to draw water from the contaminated aquifer.
 
Status (July 1983) : In January 1982, $25,000 in CERCLA emergency funds were used to install carbon
filters in 16 homes and businesses with contaminated wells. The county maintains and operates the filters.
Since late 1981, EPA has approved $632,000 (some of it under a Cooperative Agreement) for a remedial
investigation to determine the extent and type of contamination at the site and a feasibility study to identify
alternatives for remedial action. The work, scheduled to begin in the third quarter of 1983, includes a
modeling of the aquifer system to identify source(s) of contamination.
