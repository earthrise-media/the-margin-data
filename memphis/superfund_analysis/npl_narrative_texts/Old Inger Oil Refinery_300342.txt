NPL Site Narrative for Old Inger Oil
Refinery
 
OLD INGER OIL REFINERY
Darrow, Louisiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Old Inger Oil Refinery Site covers 14 acres near Darrow,
Louisiana, in Ascension Parish. It was obtained by the company in 1976 to reclaim oil from refinery
wastes. A spill in 1978 contaminated a large surface area. In 1981, Louisiana officially declared the site
"abandoned." It has nine oil storage tanks, which have overflowed into nearby holding ponds and a swamp.
The site is easily accessible to people, vehicles, and animals. Ground water and soil are contaminated by
organic chemicals.
 
This is the top priority site in Louisiana.
 
Status (July 1983) : In September 1982, EPA awarded a $210,000 Cooperative Agreement to Louisiana
for a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site. The work is
scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983. In April 1983, EPA added $180,000 to the
Cooperative Agreement for conducting a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action at the
site. Also in April, $47,000 in CERCLA emergency funds were used to construct a diversion levee, repair a
breach in the lagoon dike, conduct treatability studies on water and sludges, and fence the site.
 
EPA has identified parties potentially responsible for wastes at the site and is seeking their cooperation in
the cleanup.
