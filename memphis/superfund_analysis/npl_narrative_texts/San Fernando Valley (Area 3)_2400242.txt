NPL Site Narrative for San Fernando
Valley (Area 3)
 
SAN FERNANDO VALLEY (AREA 3)
Glendale, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : San Fernando Valley (Area 3) is an area of contaminated
ground water in the vicinity of the Glorietta Well Field in the City of Glendale, Los Angeles County,
California. This area is part of the San Fernando Valley Basin, a natural underground reservoir that
represents an important source of drinking water for at least 3 million people in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area. The contaminated ground water, which underlies an area of approximately 5,200
acres, contains trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE), according to tests conducted by the
California Department of Health Services, as well as numerous local government agencies. The State's
recommended drinking water guidelines for TCE and PCE (5 and 4 parts per billion respectively) are
exceeded in a number of public wells in this area. To alleviate this contamination, wells are either taken out
of service or blended with water from clean sources to ensure that the public receives water with TCE/PCE
concentrations below the State's guidelines.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are entering into a
cooperative agreement for a remedial investigation of the San Fernando Valley Basin and a feasibility
study targeted at Area 1, the most contaminated area. The RI is scheduled to begin in early 1986.
