NPL Site Narrative for Goose Farm
 
GOOSE FARM
Plumstead Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Goose Farm is a 1.5-acre site in a rural area of Plumstead
Township, Ocean County, New Jersey. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, drums and free-flowing
liquids were dumped into an excavation, which was later covered with soil. PCBs and other toxic organic
chemicals have been detected in air, ground water, and surface water. With the State as the lead agency,
emergency removal actions began at the site in late 1980.
 
Goose Farm, the Friedman Property, Pijack Farm, and Spence Farm (the so-called "Plumstead Sites") are
within a 2-mile radius.
 
Status (July 1983) : The emergency actions ended in February 1982. They included excavation and
disposal off-site of more than 4,800 containers, 3,000 cubic yards of highly contaminated soil, and over
9,000 gallons of bulked liquid wastes. A system was installed to treat 7.7 million gallons of ground water.
Site cleanup was funded initially under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act and the New Jersey Spill
Compensation Fund. Later, CERCLA emergency funds were used. By late 1981, the State had spent $4
million on the site and EPA $2.4 million. Ground water in and near the site continues to be contaminated
with significant levels of organic compounds and heavy metals.
 
In September 1982, EPA awarded a $189,000 Cooperative Agreement to New Jersey for a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action at the site. It is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of
1984.
