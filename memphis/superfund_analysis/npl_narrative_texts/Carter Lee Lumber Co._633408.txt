NPL Site Narrative for Carter Lee Lumber
Co.
 
CARTER LEE LUMBER CO.
Indianapolis, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Carter Lee Lumber Co. has been selling wood and lumber in
Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana, since 1873. In about 1971, Carter bought 2-3 acres of land in back of
its original property from the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railway Co., an offshoot of Penn
Central. According to Carter, the railway company dumped unknown quantities of liquid wastes from tank
trucks and railroad cars onto the ground and into a 14-foot trench on the property.
 
Soil samples collected in July 1985 by EPA are contaminated with phenanthrene, di-n-butylphthalate,
fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo (a) anthracene, chrysene, benzo (b and k) fluoranthene, benzo (a) pyrene,
indeno (1,2,3-cd) anthracene, benzo (g,h,i) perylene, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium.
 
The site is on the floodplain of the White River. The sand and gravel below the floodplain are permeable
and ground water is shallow (20 feet in some places), conditions that facilitate movement of contaminants
into ground water. An estimated 710,000 people obtain drinking water from municipal wells within 3 miles
of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
