HEBELKA AUTO SALVAGE YARD
Weisenberg Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Hebelka Auto Salvage Yard has been in business on a
10-acre site in Weisenberg Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, since 1958. Inspections conducted
by EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (PA DER) have revealed an
estimated 750 to 1,000 cubic yards of battery casings in uncovered on-site piles covering 0.5 acre.
According to tests conducted by EPA, on-site soil, sediments in a drainage way, and sediments in an
off-site stream contain elevated levels of mercury and lead. An on-site well also has elevated levels of
mercury, according to EPA. About 2,750 people draw water from three Lehigh County Water Authority
wells within 3 miles of the site. Another 500 people use private wells.
 
The site is approximately 300 feet upgradient of Iron Run, a tributary to the Little Lehigh, which is a high-
quality fishing stream.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA is preparing a workplan for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
