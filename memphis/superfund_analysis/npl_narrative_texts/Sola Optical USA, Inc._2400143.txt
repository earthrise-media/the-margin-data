NPL Site Narrative for Sola Optical USA,
Inc.
 
SOLA OPTICAL USA, INC.
Petaluma, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Sola Optical USA, Inc., has manufactured optical lenses at its
35-acre facility at 3600 Lakeville Highway, Petaluma, Petaluma County, California, since 1978. In May
1982, the California Department of Health Services identified acetone in a well on the Sola property.
Subsequently, consultants for Sola Optical reported that soil adjacent to six underground solvent storage
tanks at the facility was contaminated with trichloroethane (TCA) and methylene chloride. In 1985, Sola
removed the tanks and confirmed that shallow ground water under the site was contaminated with volatile
organic compounds, including 1,1-dichloroethylene, TCA, and 1,1-dichloroethane.
 
A public well, Petaluma Station 5 City Well, is approximately 500 feet from contaminated wells on-site. The
well is joined to the Petaluma Water Department distribution system, which serves an estimated 50,000
people. In 1986 and 1987, the well contained low levels of TCA and other solvents in several samples
taken by the California Department of Health Services and by Sola. Tests conducted in November 1986 by
the California State Water Resources Control Board showed a hydraulic connection between the Station 5
well and several on-site contaminated wells, establishing the potential for site contaminants to migrate into
the Station 5 well.
 
In May 1985, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board issued Waste Discharge Requirements
calling for Sola to conduct ground water studies. In April 1987, the board issued Site Cleanup
Requirements calling for Sola to determine the lateral and vertical extent of ground water contamination
and to propose remedial action alternatives.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : In response to the April 1987 requirements, Sola has installed nine new
monitoring wells and seven extraction wells and has begun to operate a system to pump shallow ground
water to the surface and treat it with activated carbon to remove VOGs. To improve the system's efficiency,
the Station 5 well is not pumped while the system operates.
 
On October 2, 1989, EPA and Sola signed an Administrative Order on Consent under CERCLA Sections
104 and 122 for Sola to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent
of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
