NPL Site Narrative for Boise Cascade/
Onan Corp./Medtronics, Inc.
 
BOISE CASCADE/ONAN CORP./MEDTRONICS, INC.
Fridley, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : From the mid-1920s to the early 1960s, Boise Cascade
preserved railroad ties and poles with creosote and pentachlorophenol on a 170-acre site in Fridley,
Minnesota. The northern portion of the site is now owned by Onan Corp., and the remainder by Medtronic,
Inc. Waste water containing creosote and oil collected in two lagoons on what is now Medtronic property.
Soil and ground water on both properties have been extensively studied by consultants representing the
two owners. Monitoring wells on-site have detected elevated levels of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
and phenolic compounds. Sediments from Rice Creek and Norton Creek contain the same contaminants,
as do soil borings throughout the site. Creosote sludge was also found at the bottom of a deep multiaquifer
well on the site. Ground water is the route of major concern because Moundsview and Fridley municipal
wells are nearby. Ground water contamination could affect nearly 20,000 people.
 
Status (June 1984) : Medtronic has entered into a Consent Decree with the State for its portion of the site.
The cleanup is scheduled to be completed by the end of the summer of 1984.
 
For the Onan portion of the site, Onan, Boise, and two railroads are now in court to decide responsibility
and remedy.
