NPL Site Narrative for Gallup's Quarry
 
GALLUP'S QUARRY
Plainfield, Connecticut
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Gallup's Quarry is a former gravel mining operation in a rural
area on Tarbox Road 1 mile south of Plainfield's business district in Windham County, Connecticut. During
1974-77, the privately owned 22-acre site accepted chemical waste without a permit. According to the
Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP), methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl
ketone, toluene, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane were disposed on-site
in drums and as free liquids. Several of these volatile organic chemicals, as well as copper, nickel, and
chromium, have been detected in on-site monitoring wells by CT DEP (1980-81) and EPA (1986).
 
A community well is 4,000 feet and a private well 1,160 feet from the site. An estimated 6,500 people rely
on wells within 3 miles of the site as their sole source of drinking water.
 
Mill Brook and associated wetlands are 500 feet downslope of the site. Local surface waters are used for
recreational activities.
 
The site is unfenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact with hazardous
substances.
 
In 1978, the site was evaluated and drums and contaminated soil removed under the direction of CT DEP
and the State police. The owner agreed to reimburse the State up to $750,000 for the removal operation at
Gallup's Quarry and at another property he owned. However, limited soil analyses conducted by CT DEP in
1981 indicate that soil contaminated with ketone and hydrocarbons remains on-site.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : In January 1989, EPA sampled private drinking water wells and found no
contamination. Subsequent review by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry confirmed
EPA findings. EPA emergency staff, therefore, has determined that no removal action is warranted at this
time.
