PALMETTO WOOD PRESERVING
Dixiana, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Palmetto Wood Preserving occupies about 10 acres in Dixiana,
Lexington County, South Carolina. Since about 1980, the company's process of pressure treating lumber
has resulted in excess chromated copper arsenate solution being drained to the ground. The shallow
aquifer, which supplies drinking water to some 1,000 to 2,000 people, has been contaminated. The State
has detected high levels of chromium in nearby private wells. Surface water contamination has not been
documented to date.
 
Status (June 1984) : Under a State Consent Order, the company implemented a monitoring plan in late
1983.
