NPL Site Narrative for Lexington County
Landfill Area
 
LEXINGTON COUNTY LANDFILL AREA
Cayce, South Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Lexington County Landfill Area is a 75-acre sand pit on
U.S. 321 2 miles south of Cayce, South Carolina. In 1971, the county received a permit to operate the
landfill from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). Prior to 1980,
local industries were allowed to dispose of their waste, which included asbestos, at this landfill. Adjacent to
the county landfill are the old Cayce Dump, which was in operation during the 1960s, and the old Bray Park
Dump, which was an unpermitted dump used prior to 1972.
 
In 1987, EPA found arsenic, cadmium, mercury, selenium, and 2,4-D in on-site monitoring wells. An
estimated 6,200 people obtain drinking water from public and private wells within 3 miles of the site. A local
resident had to abandon his contaminated well which tapped a shallow aquifer. The shallow and deeper
aquifers are hydraulically connected, so that water can move between them. Approximately 250 acres of
farmland are irrigated by a well within 3 miles of the site.
 
The Lexington County Department of Public Works is working with SCDHEC to monitor ground water in the
area.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
