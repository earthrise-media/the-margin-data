NPL Site Narrative for Bennington
Municipal Sanitary Landfill
 
BENNINGTON MUNICIPAL SANITARY LANDFILL
Bennington, Vermont
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Bennington Municipal Sanitary Landfill in Bennington,
Bennington County, Vermont, occupies 28 acres, 10 of which now serve as a sanitary landfill. Before the
site was a landfill, it was a sand and gravel pit. The town of Bennington leased the landfill during 1969-85,
then purchased the property. In September 1983, the town received a permit from the Vermont Department
of Environmental Conservation (VT DEC) to dispose of municipal wastes on the 10 acres.
 
During 1969-75, liquid industrial wastes from several Bennington industries were disposed of in an unlined
lagoon. The wastes included PCBs, organic solvents, and lead, according to town records. The lagoon was
closed in 1975, and after attempts to dewater it failed, it was filled in with landfill material.
 
A buried drain system constructed in 1976 is designed to lower the ground water level under the landfill.
The system discharges through a culvert into an unlined, ponded area. In August 1986, VT DEC detected
PCBs, lead, arsenic, benzene, and ethylbenzene in the ground water discharging from the culvert.
 
Morgan Spring, a bedrock water source 2.8 miles south of the landfill, is regularly used to supplement the
Bennington water system. In addition, approximately 2,200 residents use private wells within 3 miles of the
site. In all, an estimated 13,600 people are potentially affected.
 
In August 1986, VT DEC analyses detected bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate in sediment in Hewitt Brook, which
is used for fishing, within 3 miles downstream of the site. A fresh water wetland is 500 feet east of the
culvert.
 
VT DEC detected several flammable materials, including ethylbenzene, toluene, and xylene, in the culvert.
In June 1985, the culvert caught fire.
 
The site is not completely fenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact
with hazardous substances.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
