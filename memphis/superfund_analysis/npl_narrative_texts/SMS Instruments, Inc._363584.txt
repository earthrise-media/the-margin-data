SMS INSTRUMENTS, INC.
Deer Park, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : SMS Instruments, Inc., overhauled military aircraft
components in Deer Park, Town of Babylon, Suffolk County, New York, between 1971 and 1983. The
site consists of a one-story building occupying 34,000 square feet on a 1.5-acre lot that is largely paved.
Industrial wastes generated from degreasing and other refurbishing operations were routinely discharged
to a leaching pool on-site. In 1979-80, the Suffolk County Department of Health detected solvents in the
pool. The county installed monitoring wells, which proved to be contaminated with 1,1,1-trichloroethane.
Ground water is the only water supply source in the area. A public well field and pump station are less than
1 mile south, the general direction of ground water flow. Over 10,000 people draw drinking water from wells
within 3 miles of the site.
 
In March 1980, the county issued a modified Consent Order to SMS. Violations at the site included
effluent discharges in excess of ground water standards and criteria, improper storage and disposal
of hazardous wastes, and failure to apply for a State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.
Subsequent investigations at the site during 1981 revealed 70 drums stored outdoors unprotected, some
showing evidence of corrosion and leakage. Also in 1981, an underground 6,000-gallon jet fuel tank failed
a pressure test, suggesting an additional threat to ground water.
 
The site is 75 feet above sea level. Topography is generally flat with the exception of a steep embankment
leading to a large basin 50 feet from the eastern property line. The basin recharges ground water.
The headwaters of Sampawams Creek, which feeds into Guggenheim Lakes, lie 1 mile southeast.
Belmont Lake State Park is less than 2 miles south-southwest. The immediate vicinity is light industrial,
but predominant land use in the surrounding area is commercial and residential. Approximately 5,000
residences are within 1 mile of the site. Several schools are to the south.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
