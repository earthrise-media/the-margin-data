NPL Site Narrative for Odessa Chromium
#2 (Andrews Highway)
 
ODESSA CHROMIUM #2 (ANDREWS HIGHWAY)
Odessa, Texas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Odessa Chromium #2 Site consists of a 20-acre portion
of an aquifer contaminated with chromium in the area of Andrews Highway, just northwest of the city
limits of Odessa in Ector County, Texas. Suspected as possible sources are several local industries that
generate or generated chromium-contaminated waste water from plating of metals, cleaning of radiators,
and/or disposal of cooling water.
 
The first public complaint was filed in May 1970 when a residential well was found to be contaminated. In
September 1977, the State investigated the area and found chromium in three local wells. Subsequent
investigations in 1977 and 1978 determined that 10 of 34 private wells in the area had detectable
concentrations of chromium. There are 32 municipal wells within 3 miles of the site and 400 private wells
within 0.5 mile. Water from the municipal wells is blended with surface water for the Odessa water supply.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State is conducting a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. The State hired a contractor in June 1985. Field work started in September
1985 and was completed in January 1986. Of the 400 wells sampled during the investigation, 10 exceeded
drinking water standards for hexavalent chromium. The State is developing a plan for providing an
alternate drinking water supply for the persons affected.
