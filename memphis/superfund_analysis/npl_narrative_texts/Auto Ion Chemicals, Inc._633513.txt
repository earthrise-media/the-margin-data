Inc.
 
AUTO ION CHEMICALS, INC.
Kalamazoo, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Auto Ion Chemicals, Inc., Site covers 1 acre in Kalamazoo,
Michigan. Between 1963 and 1973, the company treated chromium plating wastes on the site. About
122,000 gallons of liquid plating wastes and sludges remain on-site in three basement areas and an
outside concrete-lined lagoon. While the plant operated, the State documented numerous discharges
of pollutants to the ground, sewers, and Kalamazoo River. Hexavalent chromium and cyanide were
detected in spills on the ground and in the river. Two city wells located within 1.3 miles of the site may be
threatened. The wells are part of the Kalamazoo municipal system, which provides water to over 100,000
residents.
 
In 1981, Kalamazoo tried to condemn the facility. The owner filed for an injunction, but the case was
dropped when the property reverted to the State because the owner failed to pay taxes. Vandals have
repeatedly destroyed sections of the fence around the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the
full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
