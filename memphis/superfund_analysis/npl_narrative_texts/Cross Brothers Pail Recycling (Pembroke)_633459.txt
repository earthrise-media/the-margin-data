NPL Site Narrative for Cross Brothers Pail
Recycling (Pembroke)
 
CROSS BROTHERS PAIL RECYCLING (PEMBROKE)
Pembroke Township, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Cross Brothers Pail Recycling Site covers 20 acres in
rural Pembroke Township, 15 miles southeast of Kankakee, Illinois. Between 1961 and 1980, pails and
drums were recycled at the site by burning out the residue, using hazardous waste solvents as fuel, and
then sandblasting and painting. During these operations, soil and ground water became contaminated.
Investigations by the State discovered over 10,000 5-gallon pails (mostly empty), 10 acres of contaminated
soil, at least 10 covered trenches of unknown wastes, and a plume of contaminated ground water
leaving the site. The State has notified four families with downgradient wells that their water supplies are
contaminated with a number of toxic organic chemicals. The State completed a hydrogeological study of
the site in 1981. On August 19, 1980, the Kankakee County Circuit Court ordered the site owners to cease
operations and clean up the surface debris.
 
Status (July 1983) : In May 1983, EPA signed a $220,871 Cooperative Agreement with Illinois for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of
1984.
