NPL Site Narrative for Quality Plating
 
QUALITY PLATING
Sikeston, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Quality Plating Site covers about 5 acres in Sikeston,
Scott County, Missouri. The site consists of a 1-acre unlined lagoon and the manufacturing plant. From
1978 until the facility was destroyed by fire on February 12, 1983, Quality Plating was engaged in contract
electroplating of common and precious metals, which included cadmium, lead, chromium (in the highly
toxic hexavalent form), copper, nickel, and zinc. Untreated waste water originating from the flow-through
rinse tanks, as well as acid, alkaline, and metal-plating batch solutions, was continuously discharged into
the lagoon at a rate of at least 10,000 gallons per day. The State detected elevated levels of chromium and
lead in an on-site well. The State has also repeatedly cited the company for discharging untreated plating
waste to subsurface waters of the State, in violation of the company's permit under the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System.
 
The site is located in a rural setting. The present owner raises hogs and calves on the former property of
Quality Plating. Six residences within 0.25 mile of the site obtain drinking water from shallow wells.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : A multisite cooperative agreement between EPA and the State covering five sites,
including Quality Plating, was approved September 9, 1985. Initial funding is for planning activities.
