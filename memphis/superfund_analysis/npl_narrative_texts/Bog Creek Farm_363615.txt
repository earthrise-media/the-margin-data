NPL Site Narrative for Bog Creek Farm
 
BOG CREEK FARM
Howell Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Bog Creek Farm Site in Howell Township, New Jersey, is a
4-acre dump at the rear of a 12-acre farm. The site is adjacent to the North Branch of Squankum Brook.
Paint wastes, oils, lacquer thinners, paint solvents, metal paints, paint resins, creosol, and disinfectants
were dumped on the site.
 
Many of these chemicals are leaching into Squankum Brook, which leads to the Manasquan River. The
Manasquan is used for fishing, boating, and swimming. Allaire State Park is just downstream. These same
chemicals contaminate the nearby aquifer. Citizens have frequently complained of odors coming from the
site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
