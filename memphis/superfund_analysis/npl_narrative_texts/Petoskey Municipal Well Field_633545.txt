NPL Site Narrative for Petoskey Municipal
Well Field
 
PETOSKEY MUNICIPAL WELL FIELD
Petoskey, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Petoskey Municipal Well Field is in Petoskey, Emmet
County, Michigan, on the shore of Little Traverse Bay and the delta of the Bear River. It is the city's sole
source of water. In September 1981, the State detected 20 to 50 parts per billion of trichloroethylene in the
city's water supply. An adjacent die casting and plating firm, Petoskey Manufacturing, was suspected of
being the source of contamination. The company commissioned an extensive hydrogeologic investigation
to determine the extent of its responsibility, if any.
 
Status (July 1983) : The city appropriated funds for new wells and installed monitoring wells in the new
field. The State is reviewing Petoskey Manufacturing's proposed investigation.
