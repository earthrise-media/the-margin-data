NPL Site Narrative for Bush Valley Landfill
 
BUSH VALLEY LANDFILL
Abingdon, Maryland
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Bush Valley Landfill covers 29 acres in Abingdon, Harford
County, Maryland. Before 1977, it allegedly was used for the open burning of trash. The property, which
was privately owned, was used as a landfill for municipal wastes during 1977-82. During this period, the
landfill had a State permit to accept municipal wastes.
 
American Cyanamid Co. notified EPA, as required by CERCLA Section 103(c), that its plant in Havre de
Grace, Maryland, had sent wastes containing imides, amines, amides, elastomers, and asbestos to Bush
Valley Landfill.
 
During 1979-84, the State issued orders regarding the landfill's operating procedures and closure plans.
The owner of the facility never complied fully with the orders.
 
During a site inspection in July 1984, EPA observed erosion and leachate seeping from slopes of the
landfill. There were no diversion ditches or leachate collection systems. The landfill was only partially
covered. An on-site monitoring well contained trans-1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride.
 
The Perryman Water Treatment Plant supplies 30,000 - 35,000 people from eight municipal wells. Three
of the eight wells are within 3 miles of the site. Water is blended into the system, so the entire population
could be affected if one or more wells become contaminated. A few private wells are nearby, the closest a
shallow well 1,500 feet away.
 
Run-off from the landfill goes to two basins on the site. A pipeline from one basin runs into Bynum Run 300
feet away. Bynum Run is tidally influenced in the vicinity of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is conducting a search to identify parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site. The search is expected to be completed early in 1989.
