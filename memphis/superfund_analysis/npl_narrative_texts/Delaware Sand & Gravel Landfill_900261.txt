NPL Site Narrative for Delaware Sand &
Gravel Landfill
 
DELAWARE SAND & GRAVEL LANDFILL
New Castle County, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Delaware Sand & Gravel Landfill covers 10 acres adjacent to
the Army Creek Landfill in New Castle County, Delaware. Both landfills accepted municipal and hazardous
waste. According to reports EPA received, about 7,500 drums of liquid waste were opened and emptied
into an unlined trench on the Delaware Sand & Gravel Landfill, which is privately owned. The underlying
aquifer and surrounding surface waters are contaminated by a variety of organic and inorganic hazardous
substances from both sites. The site closed in 1976 when the State filed suit against the owners for
improper operating procedures. The landfill was covered with sand and gravel, which are very permeable.
 
This site was first listed under the name "Delaware Sand & Gravel-Llangollen Army Creek Landfills."
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. Any measures taken at the site will be in
conjunction with activities proposed at the Army Creek site.
 
The State suit against the site owner is not yet resolved.
