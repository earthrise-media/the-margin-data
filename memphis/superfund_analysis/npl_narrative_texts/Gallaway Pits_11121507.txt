NPL Site Narrative for Gallaway Pits
 
GALLAWAY PITS
Gallaway, Tennessee
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Gallaway Pits cover 10 acres near Gallaway, Tennessee.
They are a series of old gravel pits used for unpermitted dumping of municipal and industrial wastes.
Illicit dumping of pesticide-containing waste was discovered in 1981. In February 1982, the State ordered
dumping to stop. The responsible party failed to comply with a State-ordered cleanup. The types and
quantities of waste at this site, principally pesticides, indicate a potential for ground water contamination,
although State samples for residential wells in the area show no contamination. While the waste material
appears to be contained in the ponds, any migration could pass through the underlying sand and gravel
and enter the aquifer.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is considering an emergency action to deal with the most highly contaminated
areas and a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the
site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
