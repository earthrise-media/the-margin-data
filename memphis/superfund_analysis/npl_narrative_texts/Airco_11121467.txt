NPL Site Narrative for Airco
 
AIRCO
Calvert City, Kentucky
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Airco operated a 5-acre industrial landfill in Calvert City,
Kentucky, from the mid-1950s until 1971. Wastes in the fill include acids, crotonaldehyde, and several
mercury compounds, which were not in containers when buried in the landfill. In 1971, Air Products and
Chemicals purchased Airco's manufacturing facility and received an easement from Airco to dispose of
nonhazardous wastes in its landfill until 1980. When operations ceased, Air Products covered the landfill
and installed a drainage system. A potential problem exists with contamination of ground water and surface
water.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA recently completed a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. The plan will guide further actions at the site.
 
EPA deferred rulemaking on this site in September 1983 to allow more time for reviewing the comments
received and resolving technical issues related to its inclusion on the NPL. After further review, EPA placed
the site on the NPL.
