unlined surface impoundments that contain approximately 1 million cubic feet of waste. Pollutants,
including pentachlorophenol, benzene, naphthalene, toluene, and phenol, have migrated from the ponds,
contaminating the shallow ground water beneath the site and the Laramie River.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State and both companies agreed to conduct investigations to define the
contamination problem. The work is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983.
