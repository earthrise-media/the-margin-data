NPL Site Narrative for Tower Chemical Co.
 
TOWER CHEMICAL CO.
Clermont, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Tower Chemical Co. manufactured pesticides from 1970
until November 1980 on a 30-acre site in Clermont, Florida. About 1,000 people live in this area of Lake
County, and much of the land is devoted to orange groves. The company used DDT as an intermediate
and disposed of its wastes in a percolation pond. When rainfall caused the pond to overflow, damaging
an adjacent wetland, the company constructed a spray irrigation field for waste disposal. The State never
permitted the field. Tower Chemical stopped operations after two court orders prohibited the use of the field
and of DDT. The land was later purchased by a real estate investment group. EPA first investigated the
site in August 1980. At that time, EPA found that the percolation pond and an area where waste had been
burned were contaminating surface water and ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : In June 1983, EPA issued an order to the company under CERCLA Section 106; the
company did not respond to this order. Therefore EPA began remedial work at the site, including setting
up a water treatment system for the percolation pond, excavating the burn site, and removing the soil to an
approved disposal site.
