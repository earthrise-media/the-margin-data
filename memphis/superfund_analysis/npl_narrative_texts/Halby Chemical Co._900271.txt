HALBY CHEMICAL CO.
New Castle, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : Halby Chemical Co. was a manufacturing facility in New
Castle, New Castle County, Delaware. Its primary product was ammonium thiocyanate. In the early 1970s,
Witco Chemical Co. acquired the operation, then sold it to Brandywine Chemical Co. in 1977. Currently,
Brandywine stores finished products for distribution on the site.
 
From the late 1940s to August 1977, a waste water lagoon was in use behind the plant near the
Wilmington Marine Terminal in New Castle. The lagoon was approximately 2 feet deep, covered 1.5 acres,
and drained into the Lobdell Canal and the Christina River.
 
High levels of various organic and inorganic substances, including trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene,
arsenic, cyanide, and lead, are present in water and sediment samples from the lagoon, according to EPA
tests. EPA detected thiocyanate in the ground water underlying the site. Four municipal wells are part of an
interconnected system that supplies approximately 150,000 people living 2 to 3 miles from the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA emergency staff has assessed the site and determined that an immediate
removal action is not warranted at this time.
