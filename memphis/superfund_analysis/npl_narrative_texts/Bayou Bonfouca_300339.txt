NPL Site Narrative for Bayou Bonfouca
 
BAYOU BONFOUCA
Slidell, Louisiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Bayou Bonfouca (American Creosote) site covers 55 acres
near Slidell, Louisiana, in St. Tammany Parish. American Creosote Works, Inc., a manufacturer of wood
preservatives, operated on the site for about 100 years. In 1970, after creosote spilled from tanks during a
fire, the site was abandoned. The spill, in addition to plant operations, significantly contaminated sediments
in Bayou Bonfouca and the surrounding area.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
