FORT WAYNE REDUCTION DUMP
Fort Wayne, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Fort Wayne Reduction Dump lies on a 35-acre site in
Fort Wayne, Allen County, Indiana. National Recycling Corp. began operations at the site in 1967. Until
1976, it was used as a landfill with minimal recovery of wastes. Among the wastes accepted for disposal
were volatile industrial liquids, 2,4-dimethylphenol, methylene chloride, arsenic, and sludges (sewage,
paints, varnishes, etc.). The site is now owned by Waste Management, Inc.
 
Ground water immediately adjacent to the site is contaminated with arsenic, benzene, chloroethane,
ethylbenzene, and methylene chloride, according to tests conducted by EPA. The River Haven housing
development (estimated population 400) is within 3 miles of the site. Maumee River runs immediately
to the north. An estimated 1,100 people living south of the river use wells within 3 miles of the site as a
source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
