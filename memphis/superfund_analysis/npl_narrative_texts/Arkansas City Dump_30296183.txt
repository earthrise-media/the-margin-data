NPL Site Narrative for Arkansas City
Dump
 
ARKANSAS CITY DUMP
Arkansas City, Kansas
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Arkansas City Dump, Cowley County, Kansas, was once the
location of the Millikan Refining Co., which was destroyed by an explosion in the mid-1920s. Refinery
wastes remained on about 5 acres. There was also a series of ponds holding aqueous wastes and
covering about 5 acres, plus 0.5 acre of ponds that have been filled in. The site is near the Arkansas River.
Analyses detected trace amounts of toxic organic compounds (polynuclear aromatics) in ground water near
the disposal areas. Most of the site is owned by a local development corporation and by Arkansas City. It
has been divided into tracts and sold to small businesses.
 
In July 1981, EPA awarded a $44,700 Cooperative Agreement to Kansas, under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. The funds are for a remedial investigation to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
This is the top priority site in Kansas.
 
Status (July 1983) : In August 1982, EPA added $130,000 to the Cooperative Agreement. The remedial
investigation was completed in the first quarter of 1983. The feasibility study is scheduled to be completed
in mid-1984.
