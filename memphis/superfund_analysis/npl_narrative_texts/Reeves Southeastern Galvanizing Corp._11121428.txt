NPL Site Narrative for Reeves
Southeastern Galvanizing Corp.
 
REEVES SOUTHEASTERN GALVANIZING CORP.
Tampa, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Reeves Southeastern Galvanizing Corp. manufactures galvanized
fence wire using the hot dip process on 3 acres east of Tampa, Hillsborough County, Florida. Wash water
and periodic dumping of rinse baths from this process produce an acid liquid with high concentrations
of iron, zinc, and chromium. Since the mid-1960s, this material has been discharged into two unlined
percolation ponds on the property, contaminating both ground water and surface water with heavy metals.
Consultants for Reeves, the State, and county have conducted numerous studies that document the extent
of contamination at the site.
 
County wells are located about 1 mile upgradient of the site, and numerous private wells lie within 3 miles
of the site in all directions.
 
In 1974, Hillsborough County issued a notice of violation and a compliance schedule to Reeves. In
response, Reeves in 1981 installed an advanced waste water treatment system to neutralize the acid and
remove 90 percent of the heavy metals.
 
Status (July 1983) : Reeves plans to remove the water from the percolation ponds and take soil borings to
determine the depth of zinc contamination.
