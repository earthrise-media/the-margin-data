NPL Site Narrative for Johns' Sludge Pond
 
JOHNS' SLUDGE POND
Wichita, Kansas
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Johns' Sludge Pond is a surface impoundment in Wichita,
Kansas. Between 1951 and 1970, Super Refined Oil, now out of business, recycled waste oil there,
disposing of an estimated 7,000 cubic yards of sludge into an unlined pond. EPA found lead and organic
compounds in ground water on and very near the site. A number of private wells are in the area. In the
1970s, in order to conduct remedial actions at the site, the city took ownership of two-thirds of the property.
The Johns' estate owns the remainder.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA and the City of Wichita are negotiating for remedial action at the site.
