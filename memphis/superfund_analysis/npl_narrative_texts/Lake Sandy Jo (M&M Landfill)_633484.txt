NPL Site Narrative for Lake Sandy Jo
(M&M Landfill)
 
LAKE SANDY JO (M&M LANDFILL)
Gary, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Lake Sandy Jo (M&M Landfill) Site covers 55 acres in
Gary, Lake County, Indiana. It was a large pit that had provided fill to build the Tri-State Highway. For
several years, the pit was filled with water and was known as Lake Sandy Jo. It was emptied and in 1970,
according to the present owner/operator, filling began. Demolition wastes were put in the pit, and there
are records of hazardous waste disposal. The present owner states that "midnight dumping" occurred
frequently, and the site had been plagued by above- and below-ground fires. EPA detected benzene,
toluene, and tetrachloroethylene in ground water and surface water. Ground water contamination is the
primary concern because the area is surrounded on all sides by houses. Over 5,000 people living within 3
miles of the site draw water from more than 1,400 wells.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a draft Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the
investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions
at the site.
