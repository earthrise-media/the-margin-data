NPL Site Narrative for Frontera Creek
 
FRONTERA CREEK
Rio Abajo, Puerto Rico
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Frontera Creek in Rio Abajo, Puerto Rico, is a small creek that
receives industrial waste discharges and drains into the Caribbean Sea 2 miles downstream. Adjacent to
the creek are two large fresh water lagoons totaling about 640 acres. They are hydraulically connected to
the creek. EPA has found that mercury and pesticides are discharged into the creek. There is concern that
these contaminants could enter the aquatic food chain, contaminating finfish, shellfish, and the endangered
brown pelican. Local residents use the lagoons for fishing and recreation. The finfish and shellfish trapped
in the lagoons are significant in the local diet.
 
The land in the immediate vicinity of the lagoon is used for agriculture (cattle, sugar cane). A community
of some 100 homes is adjacent to Frontera Creek. At this time no wells are known to be used for public
water or irrigation within 3 miles of the site. Access to the lagoons is limited by barbed wire fence and a
security guard. However, EPA inspectors saw a number of local residents on the property during two site
inspections.
 
Status (July 1983) : Later in 1983, EPA plans to start a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the
investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions
at the site.
