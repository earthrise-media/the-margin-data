NPL Site Narrative for Frontier Hard
Chrome, Inc.
 
FRONTIER HARD CHROME, INC.
Vancouver, Washington
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Frontier Hard Chrome, Inc., Site covers 2 acres in
Vancouver, Washington. For a number of years in the middle to late 1970s, the company discharged
chromium-contaminated waste water from electroplating operations into a "dry well" on-site. There is no
impervious layer between the dry well and ground water beneath. Chromium, including the more toxic
hexavalent chromium, has been detected in a well supplying industrial and drinking water about 0.3 mile
from the site. Drinking water for 10,000 Vancouver residents is drawn from the same aquifer; the nearest
city well is about 1 mile from the contaminated well.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has issued an order to Frontier to stop its discharge and to prepare a plan
for remedial action. Monitoring wells are necessary to determine the extent of contamination of the aquifer.
 
EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the full
extent of cleanup required at the site.
