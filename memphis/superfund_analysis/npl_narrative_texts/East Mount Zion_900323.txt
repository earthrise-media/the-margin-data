NPL Site Narrative for East Mount Zion
 
EAST MOUNT ZION
Springettsbury Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The East Mount Zion Site covers 10 acres in Springettsbury
Township, York County, east of Mount Zion, Pennsylvania. It is on a wooded ridge whose southern and
western slopes average 70 to 80 percent grade. The privately-owned site was never permitted, according
to the State. It accepted both municipal and industrial wastes, including electroplating sludges, between
1947 and 1972, at which time it was deeded to a new owner. The land changed hands again in 1982.
 
The State detected vinyl chloride and benzene in ground water; trichloroethylene, phenol, and zinc
in leachate; and cyanide, chromium, cadmium, nickel, zinc, and copper in the electroplating sludges.
Residents within 1 mile of the site depend on ground water for their drinking water.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State and EPA have signed a Cooperative Agreement for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. Also, EPA will assess the site to determine if any immediate response is
necessary.
