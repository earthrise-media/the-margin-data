NPL Site Narrative for Fulton Terminals
 
FULTON TERMINALS
Fulton, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Fulton Terminal Site covers 2 acres adjacent to the Oswego
River in Fulton, New York. It has been alleged that up to 31,000 gallons of waste oils and sludges have
been stored in tanks on the site, which is now inactive. In recent years, the State has supervised removal
of some wastes by the owner. All but 5,000 gallons of sludge were removed and transported to an
approved disposal site.
 
The State has detected PCBs on-site. EPA sampled surface water sediment around a discharge pipe that
was once connected to one of the storage tanks. Analysis verified a number of contaminants associated
with waste oil. At present, the source of contaminants cannot be proved using analytical methods. The site
is unfenced and easily accessible.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
