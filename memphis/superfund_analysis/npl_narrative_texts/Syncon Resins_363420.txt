NPL Site Narrative for Syncon Resins
 
SYNCON RESINS
South Kearny, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : Syncon Resins once manufactured paints, varnishes, and resins on
a 5-acre site in South Kearny, Hudson County, New Jersey. The company closed in 1981 and declared
bankruptcy. The site is situated within a coastal wetlands management area and is bordered on the west
by the Passaic River, a tidal waterway. About 11,000 55-gallon drums are stored in warehouses and also
in the open on the ground. Analysis indicates that many drums contain hazardous substances. Many are
volatile and flammable, posing the threat of air pollution and fire. Some drums have rusted, spilling their
contents onto the soil. Several bulk storage tanks suspected of containing hazardous substances are also
on the site. Two unlined ponds used for subsurface disposal of process waste contain hazardous organics.
A large amount of soil is contaminated, and ground water is contaminated with organic chemicals,
including benzene, PCBs, and toluene.
 
Status (July 1983) : In December 1982, EPA awarded a $2,115,000 Cooperative Agreement to New
Jersey for (1) an initial remedial measure involving removal of surface drums and (2) a long-term feasibility
study to fill any gaps in the information on ground water and to identify alternatives for remedial action at
the site. The work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 1984.
