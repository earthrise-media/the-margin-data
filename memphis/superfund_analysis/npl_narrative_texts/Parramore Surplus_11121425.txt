NPL Site Narrative for Parramore Surplus
 
PARRAMORE SURPLUS
Mount Pleasant, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (December 30, 1982) : The Parramore Surplus Site consists of about 25 acres
near Mount Pleasant, Florida, on which surplus military equipment is stored. A State inspection found
drums of hazardous waste in four areas on the site. PCBs, solvents, and cyanide were identified in some of
the drums. Soil is also contaminated.
 
Status (September 8, 1983) : A generator removed PCB-contaminated drums and soil. The State has
accepted the operator's waste storage and consolidation plan, which will help prevent release of the
remaining drummed waste to the environment. EPA and the State will monitor implementation of the plan.
 
Status (February 21, 1989) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Florida, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
