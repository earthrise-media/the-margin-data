NPL Site Narrative for Olin Corp.
(McIntosh Plant)
 
OLIN CORP. (MCINTOSH PLANT)
McIntosh, Alabama
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Olin Corp.'s McIntosh Plant is in Washington County near
McIntosh, Alabama. The Olin facility, constructed in the early 1950s, originally manufactured chlorine and
caustic soda, using the mercury cell process. In 1956, Olin constructed a pesticide and organic chemical
plant on the site. In 1981, Olin closed the organic plant and switched from the mercury cell process to the
diaphragm cell process. Additional products still manufactured on-site include sodium chlorate, sodium
hypochlorite, and sodium chloride.
 
Olin's past waste disposal practices have contaminated ground water, according to EPA. On-site wells that
once provided the plant's drinking water are known to be contaminated. In August 1982, Olin installed a
monitoring system of 75 wells. Analyses of samples from some of the wells have detected chromium, lead,
mercury, and chlorinated aromatic compounds. Nearby wells supply the community of McIntosh and the
Ciba-Geigy and Olin plants (1,500 employees). Within 1 mile of the site is a sizeable wetlands area. To the
east of the site is the Tombigbee River.
 
Olin is continuing to study the ground water problem and regularly reports to the State.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
