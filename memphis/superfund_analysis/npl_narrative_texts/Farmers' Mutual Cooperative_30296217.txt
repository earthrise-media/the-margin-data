NPL Site Narrative for Farmers' Mutual
Cooperative
 
FARMERS' MUTUAL COOPERATIVE
Hospers, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Farmers' Mutual Cooperative Site covers approximately
6 acres in Hospers, Sioux County, Iowa, along the east side of the Floyd River. The cooperative owns
the property and has operated an agricultural supply and service business at this location since 1908. At
present, the cooperative stores bulk grain, fertilizers, and pesticides at the site.
 
In 1984, the Iowa Department of Environmental Quality found 1,2-dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride (a
grain fumigant), and chloroform in two Hospers municipal wells within 3 miles of the site. The wells, which
served an estimated 1,900 people, have been closed. The city now draws water from another well field. In
1985, a consultant to the cooperative found some of the same chemicals in on-site soils and ground water
and in Floyd River downstream of the site.
 
In August 1986, the State issued an Administrative Order requiring the cooperative to conduct a remedial
investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action. Partial results were submitted to the State in February 1987, and
negotiations culminated in a Consent Order in June 1987. The order provides for a ground water study and
completion of the RI/FS.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : The RI/FS is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1990.
