NPL Site Narrative for Kummer Sanitary
Landfill
 
KUMMER SANITARY LANDFILL
Bemidji, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Kummer Sanitary Landfill, in Bemidji, Beltrami County,
Minnesota, accepted municipal wastes from 1971 to 1984. There is no evidence that this privately owned
sanitary landfill accepted liquid and hazardous waste.
 
Monitoring wells on the property and nearby residential wells are contaminated with chlorinated organic
compounds. Analyses conducted by the State show that chloroform, trichloroethylene, methylene chloride,
and other chemicals are present in shallow ground water wells. An estimated 14,700 people use wells
from two sand aquifers for drinking water. A layer of sandy clay that may be permeable separates the
aquifers, which are within 3 miles of the site. Hence, there is a potential for wells into the deeper aquifer to
be affected.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In May 1985, under a cooperative agreement with EPA, the State began a
remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action. In July 1985, the cooperative agreement was amended to fund the
design and construction of an alternate water supply for residents of the northern townships. The alternate
water supply is currently being designed.
