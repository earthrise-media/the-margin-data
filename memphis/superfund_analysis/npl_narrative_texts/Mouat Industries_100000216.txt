NPL Site Narrative for Mouat Industries
 
MOUAT INDUSTRIES
Columbus, Montana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Mouat Industries Site is near Columbus, Stillwater
County, Montana. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the site was leased to Mouat Industries for the
processing of chromium ore to high-grade sodium dichromate. The process produced wastes containing
sodium chromate and sodium dichromate. In 1973, the Anaconda Minerals Co. removed the waste pile
and treated the area to remove hexavalent chromium remaining in the soil. Anaconda performed this work
in exchange for Mouat Industries' mineral rights at another location. In early 1975, gravel was imported
and placed on the site to a depth of 6 inches to 3 feet. By late 1976, yellow mineral deposits containing
chromium were evident on top of the ground.
 
Hexavalent chromium is present in soils on-site, as well as in ground water and surface water both on-
and off-site, according to analyses conducted by EPA and Anaconda. EPA has also detected elevated
concentrations of arsenic in surface water sediments downstream of the site. An estimated 270 people
draw drinking water from private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Ownership history of the site is now being investigated.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA recently visited the site to determine the need for an immediate removal.
