NPL Site Narrative for Columbus Old
Municipal Landfill #1
 
COLUMBUS OLD MUNICIPAL LANDFILL #1
Columbus, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Columbus Old Municipal Landfill #1 covers 10 to
12 acres on the East Fork of the White River in Columbus, Bartholomew County, Indiana. From the early
1950s through the late 1960s, the city operated the landfill, accepting municipal waste and about 3.5
million gallons of industrial wastes. It had no permits. According to a waste generator, Cummins Engine
Co., the industrial wastes included solvents, acids, bases, paints, PCBs, and heavy metals. After closing
the old landfill, Columbus opened a new landfill.
 
The old landfill is unlined and in permeable soils. It is covered with a permeable layer of sand and gravel
on which grass has grown. Wastes were deposited on the surface, and the site forms a low barrier
between the surrounding farmlands and the river. Ground water is contaminated with lead and chromium,
according to tests conducted by EPA in August 1985. The geology and location of the site are such that
area surface water is threatened.
 
About 31,000 people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water. The White
River, 100 feet from the site, is a prime fishing stream.
 
The land is privately owned and is now leased to an individual who operates waste oil storage tanks on the
site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
