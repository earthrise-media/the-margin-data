NPL Site Narrative for Vestal Water Supply
Well 1-1
 
VESTAL WATER SUPPLY WELL 1-1
Vestal, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Vestal Water Supply Well 1-1, in Vestal, Broome County,
New York, is contaminated with high levels of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and trichloroethylene. Other wells in
Water District #1 have smaller amounts of chlorinated organic chemicals. Some wells in Water District #4
are also contaminated. Further work is needed to locate and eliminate the sources endangering the water
supply for this town of 6,000 people.
 
Status (September 1983) : In December 1982, EPA proposed the Vestal Water Supply Site for listing.
Later, EPA discovered that there were two separate plumes of contaminated ground water from two
separate sources. Thus, the site was divided into two sites--Vestal Water Supply Well 1-1 and 4-2--and
both are being placed on the NPL at this time.
