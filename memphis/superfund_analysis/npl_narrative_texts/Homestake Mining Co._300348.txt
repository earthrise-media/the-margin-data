NPL Site Narrative for Homestake Mining
Co.
 
HOMESTAKE MINING CO.
Milan, New Mexico
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Homestake Mining Co. has operated a uranium mill near
Milan, New Mexico, since 1958. Seepage from two large tailings ponds on the site has contaminated a
shallow aquifer that provides water to residents in several downgradient subdivisions. The water is unsafe
for drinking and cooking.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is requiring the company to undertake long-term restoration of the aquifer
through a Ground Water Discharge Plan. The company is collecting contaminated water in the shallow
aquifer in wells and is injecting water from a deeper uncontaminated aquifer in an effort to flush and
improve the quality of the contaminated shallow aquifer.
 
EPA negotiated with the company to supply an alternate source of drinking water for residents of the
subdivisions. A Consent Decree signed in June 1983 provides for extension of the Village of Milan public
water system to the subdivisions. Under terms of the Decree, Homestake will pay for extension of the
system and hookup of individual residences, as well as monthly water charges for 10 years.
