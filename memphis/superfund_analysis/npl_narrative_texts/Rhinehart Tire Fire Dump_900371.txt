NPL Site Narrative for Rhinehart Tire Fire
Dump
 
RHINEHART TIRE FIRE DUMP
Frederick County, Virginia
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Rhinehart Tire Fire Dump Site originally served as a
storage area for 5 to 7 million tires. The 4.5-acre site is located in an agricultural area on the outskirts of
Winchester, Frederick County, Virginia. The tires caught fire in October 1983. Subsequently, EPA spent
$1.74 million in CERCLA emergency funds to control and collect 800,000 gallons of oily wastes, conduct
environmental monitoring, and perform associated activities.
 
According to EPA analyses, a variety of hazardous substances have been released to the air. In
addition, monitoring by the State has indicated local ground water contamination from similar hazardous
substances, including benzene. About 150 people use the contaminated aquifer within 3 miles of the site
as a source of drinking water.
 
In February 1984, the site owner consented to a CERCLA Section 106 order which required surface run-off
controls specified by EPA. These measures were taken in August 1984.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In March 1985, EPA started a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The
workplan for the RI/FS was recently completed.
