NPL Site Narrative for St. Regis Paper Co.
 
ST. REGIS PAPER CO.
Cass Lake, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Wheeler Division of St. Regis Paper Co. has operated a
125-acre wood-treatment facility in the rural community of Cass Lake, Cass County, Minnesota, since
1957. The site is in the Chippewa National Forest and between Pike Bay and Cass Lake. The company
once used creosote in its operations but now uses pentachlorophenol and a chrome-copper-arsenic
solution. The waste waters and sludges generated were buried in pits or a landfill or discharged to
surface impoundments. Contamination has migrated from these disposal areas into the surrounding
ground water and surface water, according to tests conducted by St. Regis. Monitoring wells on the
site are contaminated, but Cass Lake municipal wells are not as yet. A private well has a low level of
contamination.
 
St. Regis has presented a proposal to the State that includes sampling of residential wells, construction
and sampling of additional monitoring wells, further investigation of soil conditions, and investigations into
the feasibility of remedial measures.
 
Status (June 1984) : St. Regis is investigating site conditions and submits quarterly monitoring reports.
 
The State is negotiating with responsible parties to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
