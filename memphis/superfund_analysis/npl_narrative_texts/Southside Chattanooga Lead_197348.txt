SOUTHSIDE CHATTANOOG A Chattanooga, Tennessee 
Hamilton County LEAD 
Site Location: The Southside Chattanooga Lead site consists of soils contaminated by foundry by -products, located in the downtown area of Chattanooga, between the Tennessee River and the ridgeline. The approximate boundaries are Main Street (Hwy 41) to the north, Broad Street to the west, Chattanooga Creek to the south, and Central Avenue to the east. 
•Site History: The Southside Chattanooga Lead site is characterized by soil contaminated with lead as a result of the use of foundry waste material (spent foundry sand and bag house dust) as fill in the downtown area of Chattanooga. Since the mid-nineteenth century about 60 foundries, typically iron and brass, have operated in the city of Chattanooga. The two most prominent foundries were U.S. Pipe and Foundry (circa 1882) and Wheland Foundry (circa 1886), both of which were located between Broad Street and the Tennessee River in the southwestern portion of Chattanooga, and are no longer in operation. Historical information indicates that foundry waste material was used as fill to elevate flood -prone areas, channelize Chattanooga Creek, fill building sites and disposed of in local debris landfills. In the early 20th century, it was common practice for foundries to give nearby residents spent foundry sand to use as fill material. Foundry material has been found in residential and commercial properties in various locations in and around the Southside Chatta nooga area. The site is comprised of contaminated residential properties. 
•Site Contamination/Contaminants: EPA investigations have found that waste foundry material has contaminated soil at 150 residential properties with lead at levels elevated above urban background conditions. Some of the properties are contaminated with lead at levels that far exceed health-based benchmarks. 
•Potential Impacts on Surrounding Community/Environment : The EPA estimates that additional residential properties may need to be cleaned up due to elevated lead levels resulting from contaminated fill material. Further site characterization is needed to identify all of the contaminated properties. 
•Response Activities (to date): In 2012, the EPA removed lead-contaminated soil at 84 residential properties at the site. At the request of the Tennessee Department of Environmental and Conservation (TDEC), additional residential sampling was conducted in 2016 and 2017, identifying elevated lead in soils at an additional 150 residential properties. In 2017, the EPA initiated a time - critical response action to remove lead -contaminated soil at a limited number of the most highly impacted properties. In a separate response, TDEC continues to address lead contaminated soils at industrial r e-development projects with viable owners, under state authority. 
•Need for NPL Listing: The state of Tennessee referred the site to the EPA because of the risk to human health posed by lead contaminated soil in residential properties. Other federal and state cleanup programs were evaluated, but are not viable at this time because of a lack of a viable responsible party to address residential yards. The EPA received a letter of support for placing this site on the NPL from the state.  þ
