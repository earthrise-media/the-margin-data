NPL Site Narrative for Koch Refining Co./
N-Ren Corp.
 
KOCH REFINING CO./N-REN CORP.
Pine Bend, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Koch Refining Co./N-Ren Corp. Site covers 50
square miles in the Pine Bend area (cities of Inver Grove Heights and Rosemount) in Mille Lacs County,
Minnesota. In 1972, the State made an extensive investigation of wells in and near the site, which is now
an industrial park. The investigation indicated that persistent seepage from holding ponds, lagoons, and
spent bauxite piles on property owned by Koch and N-Ren was contaminating ground water with lead and
phenols. Koch and N-Ren have now either closed or upgraded and obtained proper State permits for their
operations.
 
About 1,600 people, as well as a school serving 2,600 students daily, use wells within 3 miles of the site as
a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : On October 22, 1985, the State entered into a Consent Agreement with Koch
Refining Co. to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
