Corp.
 
MCGRAW-EDISON CORP.
Albion, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The McGraw-Edison Corp. Site covers 5 acres in Albion,
Calhoun County, Michigan. The company manufactured air conditioners, humidifiers, and similar
equipment until it closed in 1980. From 1970 to 1980, still bottoms (an oil waste) contaminated with
trichloroethylene (TCE) were spread on the site's dirt roads to control dust. As a result, TCE has been
found in two on-site wells and 45 nearby residential wells. Three Albion municipal wells also show TCE
contamination.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through an enforcement action
against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
