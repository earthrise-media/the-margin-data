MID-SOUTH WOOD PRODUCTS
Mena, Arkansas
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Mid-South Wood Products processes wood on a 57-acre site in
Mena, Polk County, Arkansas. The company purchased the property in 1978. Wood-processing operations
conducted from 1967 to 1977 by the former owner contaminated surface waters with pentachlorophenol,
creosote, arsenic, and chromium. There is a strong possibility of sub-surface contamination.
 
Status (July 1983) : The potentially responsible parties, under an agreement with the State, are taking
short-term remedial measures at the site. EPA is considering a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
