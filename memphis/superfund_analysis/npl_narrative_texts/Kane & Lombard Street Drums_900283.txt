NPL Site Narrative for Kane & Lombard
Street Drums
 
KANE & LOMBARD STREET DRUMS
Baltimore, Maryland
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Kane & Lombard Street Drums Site is an 8.3-acre
abandoned, unpermitted dump in Baltimore, Maryland. Approximately 1,000 drums are on the surface of
the dump. The wastes include acrolein, benzene, ethylbenzene, xylene, lead, and chromium.
 
In September 1982, the State detected volatile organic compounds in air at the site. In June 1984, EPA
and the State used $500,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to remove surface drums and contaminants at
the site, transport the materials to a regulated disposal site, and stabilize the entire site.
 
Approximately 2,500 people live within 0.25 mile of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In July 1985, EPA started to develop a workplan for a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action. A geophysical survey was conducted in October 1985. EPA received results of initial
soil and ground water analyses in January 1986 from its contractor. The contractor is completing the
preliminary evaluation of site contamination and beginning to revise the workplan.
