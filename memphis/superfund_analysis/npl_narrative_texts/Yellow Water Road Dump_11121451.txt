NPL Site Narrative for Yellow Water Road
Dump
 
YELLOW WATER ROAD DUMP
Baldwin, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Yellow Water Road Dump is in Duval County, 1 mile
south of Baldwin and 18 miles west of Jacksonville, Florida. The 15-acre site is 0.4 mile west of Yellow
Water Road, Florida State Route 217, and is accessible by an unimproved road.
 
From 1981 to 1984, transformers, tanks, and drums filled with PCBs, waste oils, and solvents were
transported to the site for disposal. The operation ended when the property was rezoned. By that time,
approximately 63,000 gallons of oil and transformer fluid containing PCBs had leaked from containers,
drums, and tanks, according to EPA. Soil on the site is contaminated with PCBs, according to analyses
conducted by the city.
 
On November 29 and December 5, 1984, EPA issued notice letters under CERCLA Section 104 providing
potentially responsible parties the opportunity to take corrective action. None of the parties agreed, and in
December 1984, EPA used CERCLA emergency funds to contain the hazardous wastes on the site. The
containment work was completed in March 1985. However, there is still a potential threat to nearly 150
people drawing drinking water from shallow ground water. An unnamed recreational pond 2,000 feet north
of the site is also threatened.
 
On June 14, 1985, EPA issued a unilateral Administrative Order under CERCLA Section 106 to prevent the
site owner from removing transformers from the site without prior approval from EPA.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
