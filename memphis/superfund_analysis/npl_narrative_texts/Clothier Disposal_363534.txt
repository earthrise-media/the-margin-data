NPL Site Narrative for Clothier Disposal
 
CLOTHIER DISPOSAL
Town of Granby, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Clothier Disposal Site covers about 10 acres in the
Town of Granby, Oswego County, New York. The site is bounded on the north by a dirt road and on the
south by Ox Creek. Generally, it consists of wooded areas and wetlands.
 
Until 1974, the site owner accepted between 500 and 1,500 barrels of waste from Pollution Abatement
Services (which was placed on the NPL in September 1983) in nearby Oswego. Inspections conducted by
the State indicated that many barrels were in poor condition and leaking; solvent odors were noted. PCBs
are present in soil samples, according to analyses conducted by the State. The contamination threatens
ground water and surface water. Nearby residents use private or municipal wells. The site drains into a
marsh area that drains north into Ox Creek and then to the Oswego River, which is used for recreational
activities.
 
The State brought suit against the owner in November 1976 for operating without a permit. As a result,
the State granted the owner a temporary permit and a period of 1 year to clean up the site. In 1977,
the materials dumped on the site were covered; in the process, barrels were broken open and drained.
However, the case was dismissed in January 1978.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
