NPL Site Narrative for Henderson Road
 
HENDERSON ROAD
Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Henderson Road Site in Upper Merion Township,
Pennsylvania, is a well that contains such chemical wastes as benzene, chloroform, and 1,1-
dichloroethane, according to tests conducted by Philadelphia Suburban Water Co. and EPA. These wastes
pose a major threat to ground water and surface water. The Upper Merion Reservoir about 0.3 mile north
of the site provides between 8 and 12 percent of the water annually distributed by the water company to
its more than 800,000 customers. EPA drilled monitoring wells on- and off-site in January 1981, and took
samples then and in February 1983. The results confirmed ground water contamination.
 
Status (June 1984) : Using CERCLA funds, the State is undertaking a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action.
