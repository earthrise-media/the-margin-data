NPL Site Narrative for MacGillis & Gibbs/
Bell Lumber & Pole Co.
 
MACGILLIS & GIBBS/BELL LUMBER & POLE CO.
New Brighton, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : MacGillis & Gibbs Co. and Bell Lumber & Pole Co. operate
separate wood-treatment facilities on adjacent parts of a 44-acre site in New Brighton, Ramsey County,
Minnesota. These processes involve a number of materials, including creosote (not used since 1960),
pentachlorophenol, and a chrome-copper-arsenic solution (used by MacGillis from 1970 to the present).
Between 1920 and 1974, sludges from these operations were discharged to a surface impoundment in
a wetland on the site. Contaminants from the disposal site have migrated from the impoundment into the
surrounding ground water, according to analyses conducted by the two companies. Nearby wells into the
aquifer periodically contain low levels of the chemicals used at the site.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State is negotiating a Consent Order with the two companies.
