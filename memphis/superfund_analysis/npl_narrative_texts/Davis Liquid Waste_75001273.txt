NPL Site Narrative for Davis Liquid Waste
 
DAVIS LIQUID WASTE
Smithfield, Rhode Island
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Davis Liquid Waste Site occupies 10 acres near a residential
area of Smithfield, Rhode Island. The site was used as a hazardous waste disposal facility until 1977,
when it was closed by court order. Hazardous materials handled on the site include paint pigments, oils,
halogenated and nonhalogenated solvents, acids, caustics, pesticides, phenols, and laboratory wastes.
Liquid wastes in both drums and tank trucks were dumped into at least three unlined pits. Contaminated
soils and wastes in drums and tanks remain on-site. Monitoring verified that both surface water and ground
water are contaminated. A plume of contaminated ground water is migrating northward through highly
fractured bedrock. The main point of discharge appears to be into Latham Brook.
 
Status (July 1983) : In August 1982, EPA awarded a $336,182 Cooperative Agreement to Rhode Island for
a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and for a feasibility
study to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the fourth
quarter of 1983. The next step, if approved, would be to select the cost-effective remedy and begin design
activities.
 
The State has an enforcement action underway against the site owner.
