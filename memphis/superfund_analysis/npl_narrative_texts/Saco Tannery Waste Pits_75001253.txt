NPL Site Narrative for Saco Tannery
Waste Pits
 
SACO TANNERY WASTE PITS
Saco, Maine
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Saco Tannery Waste Pits occupy about 225 acres in Saco,
Maine. The property, presently owned by Maine Guarantee Corp., was abandoned by Saco Tanning Corp.
when it filed for bankruptcy. On-site are about 30 lagoons and pits ranging in size from about 30 to 60
square feet, as well as two large chromium pits several acres in size.
 
In excess of 23 million gallons of chrome sludge, acids, alkaline sludge, and methylene chloride
sludges were disposed of on the site. Some pits contain highly acid liquids and several chlorinated
organic chemicals. The pits are unfenced. No samples of on-site ground water have been analyzed.
However, ground water is shallow, making contamination possible. Private drinking water wells show no
contamination as yet.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a remedial plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. The plan recommends initial remedial measures
involving emptying the acid pits and restricting site access.
