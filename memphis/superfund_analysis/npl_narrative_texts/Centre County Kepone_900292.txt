NPL Site Narrative for Centre County
Kepone
 
CENTRE COUNTY KEPONE
State College Boroug, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Centre County Kepone Site is a batch chemical
manufacturing plant near State College Borough, Pennsylvania. The company manufactured Mirex in 1973
and 1974, and Kepone in 1958, 1959, and 1963.
 
Progress wastes were originally disposed of on-site in a spray irrigation field and lagoon and stored in
drums. The company later removed the drums and contaminated soil, treated the material in the lagoon to
harden it, and buried it on-site. The material from the lagoon failed to harden properly, and contaminants
were leaching to ground water and surface water. In 1982, the company excavated and removed the
material and started to treat contaminated ground water.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is planning additional sampling to determine the need for further remedial action
at the site.
