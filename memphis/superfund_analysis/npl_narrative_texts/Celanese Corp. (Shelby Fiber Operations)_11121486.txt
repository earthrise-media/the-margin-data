CELANESE CORP. (SHELBY FIBER OPERATIONS)
Shelby, North Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Celanese Corp. manufactures synthetic fibers in a plant
in Shelby, Cleveland County, North Carolina. Between 1970 and 1978, the company used a 3-acre area
on the plant for the temporary storage of drums of waste chemicals and solvents. During the 1960s,
combustible materials, including oils and solvents, were burned in the open in a smaller area on the plant.
 
Monitoring wells on the plant are contaminated with organic chemicals in the parts-per-million range,
according to tests conducted by Celanese. Within 0.25 mile of the site are 47 private drinking water wells;
the closest is approximately 1,500 feet downgradient of the monitoring well with the highest levels of
organic chemicals. The site is located approximately 3,500 feet from Buffalo Creek, the source of the
plant's drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Celanese has submitted a workplan to EPA for a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
action. EPA has approved the workplan and is discussing future activity at the site with Celanese.
