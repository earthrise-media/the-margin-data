NPL Site Narrative for Schmalz Dump
 
SCHMALZ DUMP
Harrison, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Schmalz Dump is a privately owned and unauthorized site
in a 0.7-acre wetland in Harrison, Calumet County, Wisconsin. The wetland empties into Lake Winnebago
0.3 mile downstream. A municipal water supply intake for the City of Appleton is within 2 miles of the site.
 
While in use from 1971 to 1979, the site accepted demolition debris and power plant ash. In late 1978 and
early 1979, 2,500 cubic yards of demolition waste containing PCBs were dumped. EPA has documented
up to 1,600 parts per million PCBs in soil and demolition waste at the site. PCBs have not been shown
to be migrating off-site. However, the high concentrations of PCBs could be a threat to nearby residential
wells, surface waters, and the water supply intake.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA plans to collect samples near the site to determine if PCBs are migrating off-site.
