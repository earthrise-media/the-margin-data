NPL Site Narrative for Libby Ground Water
Contamination
 
LIBBY GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION
Libby, Montana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Libby Ground Water Contamination Site covers 1,500 acres
in Libby, Montana. In April 1979, in response to a homeowner's complaint of an irritating "creosote" odor
in water from a new well, the State found elevated levels of pentachlorophenol (PCP). In September 1980,
EPA, the State, and St. Regis Paper Co. discussed possible sources of contamination, including the way
the company disposed in the past of creosote and other preservatives formerly used to treat wood.
 
In June 1981, EPA and county officials tested 11 wells in the Libby area for PCP and polynuclear aromatic
hydrocarbon components of creosote. Significant levels of these contaminants were found in some wells.
 
Status (July 1983) : St. Regis is sampling ground water to define the extent of contamination. Results are
expected in July 1983.
