NPL Site Narrative for Cortese Landfill
 
CORTESE LANDFILL
Village of Narrowsburg, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Cortese Landfill covers approximately 17 acres in the
Delaware River floodplain in the Village of Narrowsburg, Town of Tusten, Sullivan County, New York. The
former operator of the landfill is the John Cortese Construction Corp. The company owns a portion of the
property. The town owns the rest.
 
The landfill received municipal wastes from the Town of Tusten at a rate of 3,000 cubic yards per year from
1972 to 1982. In addition, significant quantities of industrial wastes were buried at the landfill.
 
The State has documented the release of organic chemicals and metals to surface water and ground water
at or near the site. The nearest known water supply (800 feet to the northwest) is the auxiliary well for the
Narrowsburg water supply. To date, no significant impacts on water supplies have been detected.
 
The State initiated a lawsuit under CERCLA against several parties in Federal District Court in August
1983.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : In April 1985, the State signed a Consent Order with SCA Services, Inc.,
which had transported wastes to the site. The Consent Order requires SCA to undertake a remedial
investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action. The work began in the summer of 1985. The RI is scheduled to be
completed in September 1986.
