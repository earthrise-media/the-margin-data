NPL Site Narrative for Louisiana-Pacific
Corp.
 
LOUISIANA-PACIFIC CORP.
Oroville, California
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Louisiana-Pacific Corp. Site covers 100 acres southwest
of Oroville, Butte County, California. The facility consists of a sawmill, a planing mill, and a hardboard
plant. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is sprayed on the lumber as a preservative. Soil and sawdust on the site
contain high levels of PCP. Both shallow and deep ground water under the site are contaminated with
PCP, according to analyses conducted by an adjacent property owner and the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board (CRWQCB). About 10,500 people use ground water within 3 miles of the site as a
source of drinking water.
 
The California Department of Health Services, CRWQCB, and EPA are attempting to determine the extent
of contamination and identify the actions necessary to clean up the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA has completed a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site and in February 1986 sent notice letters to Louisiana-Pacific Corp and Georgia-
Pacific Corp., former owner of the site. In the next step, EPA will negotiate for the two companies to
conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the
site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
CRWQCB is sampling ground water on and off the site to determine the extent of contamination.
