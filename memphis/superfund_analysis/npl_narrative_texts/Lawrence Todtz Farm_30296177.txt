NPL Site Narrative for Lawrence Todtz
Farm
 
LAWRENCE TODTZ FARM
Camanche, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Lawrence Todtz Farm is about 1 mile west of
Camanche, Clinton County, Iowa. The site consists of 6.2 acres of abandoned gravel pits. Municipal solid
waste and industrial solid and liquid waste were disposed of in the pits between 1958 and 1975.
 
Between 1972 and 1975, 4,300 tons of liquid waste from the Clinton, Iowa, cellophane plant operated by
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc., were buried in the pits, according to information Du Pont provided
for a 1979 Congressional report on waste disposal sites (the "Eckhardt Report"). Wastes generated in the
process contain plasticizers, resins, alcohols, and heavy metal salts.
 
State studies indicate that a residential well 400 feet south of the site is contaminated with two plasticizers,
di-n-butyl-phthalate and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. The well draws from the Mississippi Alluvial Aquifer;
wells within 3 miles of the site that draw from the aquifer provide drinking water to 6,000 people.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA's Field Investigation Team will submit a report on this site shortly. The report
will be reviewed to determine future response actions.
