(Industrial Waste Disposal Co., Inc.)
 
SANITARY LANDFILL CO. (INDUSTRIAL WASTE DISPOSAL CO.,
INC.)
Dayton, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Sanitary Landfill Co., which is owned by Industrial
Waste Disposal Co., Inc., operated a 40-acre landfill near Dayton, Montgomery County, Ohio, from 1965
to 1980. The landfill reportedly accepted municipal wastes and various types of industrial wastes, including
solvents. The landfill is located above gravel deposits. About 110,000 people draw drinking water from
wells within 3 miles of the site. The wells are drilled into a deeper aquifer, which may be connected to the
shallow gravel deposits, according to a study conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey. Thus, there is a
potential for contamination of public water wells.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
