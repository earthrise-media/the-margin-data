NPL Site Narrative for Hardage/Criner
 
HARDAGE/CRINER
Criner, Oklahoma
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Hardage (Criner) site covers 40 to 60 acres near Criner,
McClain County, Oklahoma. The site consists of several surface impoundments and a drum burial area.
More than 18 million gallons (bulk and containerized liquids and solids) were disposed of at the site, which
was licensed by the State to accept industrial wastes. It started operating in late 1972 and continued until
late 1980.
 
Substances found on-site include pesticides, solvents, alcohols, waste oils, paints, acids, caustics, and
metal sludges. In 1976, the State found that on-site monitoring wells were contaminated. Subsequently,
the State initiated an administrative enforcement action against the owner. An EPA inspection in 1979 also
detected contamination of ground water and surface water.
 
In September 1980, the Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, brought a Federal civil action seeking
injunctive relief against Mr. Hardage, the owner of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : The trial was held in September 1982, and in December 1982, the judge ruled that
an imminent and substantial endangerment existed at the site and Mr. Hardage is liable for all costs of
removal or remedial actions at the site. A second trial will be held in the near future on the costs associated
with response actions at the site.
 
In June 1983, EPA allocated $200,000 for a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action at
the site.
