NPL Site Narrative for Red Oak City
Landfill
 
RED OAK CITY LANDFILL
Red Oak, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Red Oak City Landfill covers 40 acres in Red Oak,
Montgomery County, Iowa. It was owned and operated by the city from 1962 to 1974. It is now owned by a
private citizen. Prime agricultural land is adjacent to the site.
 
In June 1981, Union Carbide Corp. and Uniroyal, Inc., notified EPA, as required by CERCLA Section
103(c), that wastes they had sent to the landfill contained lead, mercury, toluene, tetrachloroethylene,
diacetone alcohol, and methyl isobutyl ketone.
 
The landfill is in permeable soil. It has no liner and was inadequately covered when it closed, according
to an EPA inspection. The contents are exposed along the bank of the East Nishnabotna River
and elsewhere. In September 1984, EPA observed leachate seeping from the landfill into the river
and collected samples of ground water, surface water, and sediment. Analyses detected toluene,
chlorobenzene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.
 
About 7,000 people depend on ground water within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water. The
nearest residence uses a private well 1,800 feet from the landfill.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
