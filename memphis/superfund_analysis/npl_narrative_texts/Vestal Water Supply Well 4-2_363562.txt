NPL Site Narrative for Vestal Water Supply
Well 4-2
 
VESTAL WATER SUPPLY WELL 4-2
Vestal, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Vestal Water Supply Well 4-2, in Vestal, Broome County,
New York, is contaminated with high levels of 1,1,1-trichloroethane and trichloroethylene. The State has
taken legal action against Monarch Chemical Co. and other potentially responsible parties concerning
contamination of the well. Other wells in Water District #4, as well as in District #1, also contain chlorinated
organic chemicals. Further work is needed to locate and eliminate the sources endangering the water
supply for this town of 6,000 people.
 
Status (September 1983) : In December 1982, EPA proposed the Vestal Water Supply Site for listing.
Later, EPA discovered that there were two separate plumes of contaminated ground water from two
separate sources. Thus, the site was divided into two sites--Vestal Water Supply Well 4-2 and 1-1--and
both are being placed on the NPL at this time.
