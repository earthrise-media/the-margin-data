NPL Site Narrative for Dover Municipal
Landfill
 
DOVER MUNICIPAL LANDFILL
Dover, New Hampshire
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Dover Municipal Landfill occupies 55 acres in the Mallego
Plains Section of Dover, New Hampshire. It is owned and has been operated by the city since 1954. At
first, it accepted domestic refuse from Dover, but by the 1960s was accepting drums and loose trash from
both Dover and Madbury. Materials buried include leather-tanning wastes, organic solvents, municipal
trash, and sludge from the Dover waste water treatment plant. After 1975, it is believed that drums were
no longer accepted. In 1977, the State installed monitoring wells around the area and found that organic
solvents were entering ground water, posing a potential threat to public water supplies for Dover and
Portsmouth. In May 1980, the State and Dover City Council closed the landfill.
 
Status (July 1983) : Dover's consultant has completed a hydrogeologic investigation of the landfill, and
EPA has completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the
full extent of cleanup required at the site. The State and EPA are negotiating a Cooperative Agreement
for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site
and identify alternatives for remedial action. At the same time, EPA is completing a search for parties
potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
