NPL Site Narrative for Clare Water Supply
 
CLARE WATER SUPPLY
Clare, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Two of the three municipal wells in the City of Clare, Clare
County, Michigan, are contaminated with chlorinated organic solvents, including dichloroethylene (DCE)
and trichloroethylene (TCE). The State discovered the contamination as part of its sampling of public
water supplies. TCE levels were as high as 57 parts per billion. The city has increased production of its
uncontaminated well and is using an aeration system to volatilize the contaminants in the other two wells.
The State has identified eight potential sources of ground water contamination. EPA installed monitoring
wells in the Clare area in August 1982.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA deferred rulemaking on this site in September 1983 to allow more time to resolve
technical issues related to its inclusion on the NPL. After further review and investigative work, EPA placed
the site on the NPL.
