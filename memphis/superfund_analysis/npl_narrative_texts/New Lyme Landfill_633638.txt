NPL Site Narrative for New Lyme Landfill
 
NEW LYME LANDFILL
New Lyme, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : New Lyme Landfill occupies 40 acres in New Lyme, Ashtabula
County, Ohio. Detailed plans for the site to operate as a sanitary landfill were approved in May 1971. The
county closed the site in 1978 because it was not complying with several landfill regulations. While in
operation, the privately owned site accepted some industrial wastes, including cyanide sludge in drums.
Leachate containing organics discharges from two sides of the fill area, threatening surface waters. There
is also concern that ground water might be contaminated by leachate from the landfill.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1983, EPA approved $360,000 to proceed with (1) a remedial investigation to
determine the type and extent of contamination both on- and off-site and (2) a feasibility study to evaluate
alternatives for controlling source(s) of contamination.
