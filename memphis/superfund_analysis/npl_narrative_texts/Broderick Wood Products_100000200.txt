NPL Site Narrative for Broderick Wood
Products
 
BRODERICK WOOD PRODUCTS
Denver, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Broderick Wood Products occupies 64 acres in an industrial
section of Denver, Colorado. It operated from 1946 to 1981, using pentachlorophenol and creosote to treat
and preserve wood. Wastes were disposed of primarily in two lagoons.
 
EPA has documented contamination of soils, ground water, and surface water. Recent data show that
the ground water north of the facility contains at least 10,000 micrograms per liter of pentachlorophenol,
making it unsafe for human consumption. An unlined irrigation ditch along the northern boundary of the site
shows trace levels of pentachlorophenol.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
