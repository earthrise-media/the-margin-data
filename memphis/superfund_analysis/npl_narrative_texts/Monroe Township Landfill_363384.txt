NPL Site Narrative for Monroe Township
Landfill
 
MONROE TOWNSHIP LANDFILL
Monroe Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Monroe Township Landfill covers 86 acres in Monroe
Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey. The landfill operated from 1955 to June 1978, when the State
closed it because a colored leachate was seeping from the site. The seepage forced the abandonment of
a nearby housing construction project. Hydrochloric acid is known to have been disposed of at the site. In
1979, the State obtained a court order against the landfill owners to correct the seepage. A 900-foot cut-
off wall and leachate collection system, which recycled leachate to the landfill, were installed as an interim
measure in 1980.
 
Status (July 1983) : A site closure plan is nearing completion. It includes the installation of a 7,000-foot
leachate cut-off wall around the perimeter of the landfill, leachate collectors, and intercepting sewers to
convey leachate to the Middlesex County Sewage Authority's Old Bridge Sewage Treatment Plant.
