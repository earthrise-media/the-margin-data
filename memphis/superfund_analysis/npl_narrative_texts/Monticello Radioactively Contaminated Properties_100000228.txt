NPL Site Narrative for Monticello
Radioactively Contaminated Properties
 
MONTICELLO RADIOACTIVELY CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES
Monticello, Utah
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Town of Monticello (population about 2,000) in San
Juan County in southeastern Utah is the site of a mill that processed vanadium and uranium ore from 1942
to 1960. Contractors operated the mill for the Federal government. Prior to the mid-1970s, radioactive
tailings were widely dispersed throughout the town. Some appear to have been used as fill material and
as aggregate for mortar and concrete, while others appear to have been carried from the mill by wind and
water. Recently, residents have indicated that some of the radioactive materials may have also originated
at another mill in Dry Valley, approximately 25 miles northeast of Monticello.
 
Various agencies, including EPA, the State Health Department, and the U.S. Department of Energy
(USDOE), have conducted radiological surveys of town properties. Above-background levels of
radioactivity were detected during each survey. USDOE has authorized cleanup of 15 properties and
is studying several more for inclusion in its Site Restoration Program. However, USDOE may lack the
authority to clean up properties contaminated by materials brought in from the mill in Dry Valley.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : USDOE studies are underway, and remedial work has begun at some properties.
The USDOE program is expected to extend through 1987.
