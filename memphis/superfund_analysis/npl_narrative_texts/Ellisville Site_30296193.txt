NPL Site Narrative for Ellisville Site
 
ELLISVILLE SITE
Ellisville, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Three properties, Callahan 28 (acres), Rosalie (85 acres), and
Bliss (12 acres), near Ellisville, Missouri, are known collectively as the Ellisville site. In 1980, a contractor
unearthed buried drums of paint solvents and pesticides while constructing a sewer line at the Callahan
property. Further investigation revealed two other areas where industrial wastes had been buried within
a 1-mile area along Caulks Creek, a tributary of the Missouri River. Leachate is flowing from the disposal
area to the creek. Ground water, which is used as drinking water, may have been contaminated.
 
This is the top priority site in Missouri.
 
Status (July 1983) : In January 1982, EPA used $310,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to excavate
drums and take other emergency actions at the Rosalie and Callahan sites. Since early February 1982,
EPA has authorized about $500,000 (part under a Cooperative Agreement with Missouri) for (1) disposal of
the excavated drums, (2) a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the
Bliss property, and (3) a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial actions at all three. The work is
scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983.
 
EPA and the State have identified parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site, and
their cooperation in the cleanup is being sought.
