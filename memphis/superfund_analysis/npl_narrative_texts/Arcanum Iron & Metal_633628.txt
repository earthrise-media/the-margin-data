NPL Site Narrative for Arcanum Iron &
Metal
 
ARCANUM IRON & METAL
Darke County, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Arcanum Iron & Metal Site covers 10 acres in Arcanum,
Darke County, Ohio. The facility has been in the scrap metal/recycling business since the early 1960s. It
now recycles lead batteries. Large piles of battery casings, lead, and lead oxides are on the property, as
well as standing pools of acid wastes. Acid overflow from this operation has killed both fish and vegetation
in Painter Creek, downstream of the site. Arcanum's water supply is furnished by wells within 1 mile of the
site, and private wells are also nearby. In October 1979, the State entered into a Consent Decree with the
owner to clean up the site, but the results were not satisfactory. The defendant subsequently was found in
contempt of the Darke County Court of Common Pleas, but the site has not been cleaned up.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
