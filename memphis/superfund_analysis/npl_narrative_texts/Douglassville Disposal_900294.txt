NPL Site Narrative for Douglassville
Disposal
 
DOUGLASSVILLE DISPOSAL
Douglassville, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Douglassville Disposal Site covers 50 acres adjacent to the
Schuylkill River in Douglassville, Pennsylvania. The company reclaims waste oils. From 1941 to 1972,
waste oil sludge was placed in on-site lagoons. The contents were washed into the Schuylkill River during
flooding in 1970 and 1972. After the 1972 flood, the sludge remaining in the lagoons was removed, and the
lagoons were filled in and seeded. Sludge generated in the oil recovery process was land farmed on the
site. From 1979 to 1982, about 700 drums, many leaking, were stored on the site. Pennsylvania ordered
the facility to remove the drums and surface soil contaminated by their storage. This was done in April
1982. A 50,000-gallon tank that may contain water contaminated with solvents remains on-site. Sampling
on the site indicates that ground water and soil in a drainage ditch have been contaminated with organic
compounds and lead. In addition, some pollutants are being released into the Schuylkill River. The drinking
water intake for the City of Pottstown is 2.3 miles downstream from the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
