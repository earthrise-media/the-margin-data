NPL Site Narrative for Nease Chemical
 
NEASE CHEMICAL
Salem, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Nease Chemical Site occupies 20 acres in Salem, Mahoning
County, Ohio. It manufactured chemicals such as pesticides and fire retardants from 1961 until 1973, when
the State closed it because it discharged waste water illegally. While the plant was operating, process
wastes were put into drums, which were then buried on-site. Also, wastes were placed in unlined lagoons
as part of waste water treatment. The drums are leaking, and the lagoons are leaching. An on-site well and
leachate from a lagoon contain organic compounds, including chlorinated organics.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
