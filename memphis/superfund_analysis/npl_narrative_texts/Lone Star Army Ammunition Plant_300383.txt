NPL Site Narrative for Lone Star Army
Ammunition Plant
 
LONE STAR ARMY AMMUNITION PLANT
Texarkana, Texas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant, located in Texarkana,
Bowie County, Texas, produces a variety of explosives and munitions. During World War II, explosives
were disposed of by detonation above- and below-ground in an area covering about 5 acres. Tests
conducted by the Army indicate that heavy metals (lead and chromium) contaminate monitoring wells
south of the disposal site along the border of the facility.
 
About 1,200 people use private wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
The plant is participating in the Installation Restoration Program, established in 1978. Under this program,
the Department of Defense seeks to identify, investigate, and clean up contamination from hazardous
materials. The Army has completed Phase I (records search). Phase II (preliminary survey) is underway.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : Phase II activities continue.
 
Within the boundaries of this Federal facility, there are areas subject to the Subtitle C corrective action
authorities of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). However, no such areas were
included in scoring this specific site. Therefore, this Federal facility site is being placed on the Federal
section of the NPL under the NPL/RCRA policy announced on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40662).
