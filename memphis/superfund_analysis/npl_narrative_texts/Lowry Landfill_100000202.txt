NPL Site Narrative for Lowry Landfill
 
LOWRY LANDFILL
Arapahoe County, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Lowry Landfill covers 250 acres in Arapahoe County, 15
miles southeast of Denver, Colorado. From 1967 to 1980, the landfill, owned and operated by the City
and County of Denver, was the major disposal site for municipal and industrial wastes generated by the
Denver metropolitan area. An estimated 100 million gallons of liquid chemical wastes, including chlorinated
solvents and oily wastes, were disposed with municipal refuse in unlined trenches excavated into surface
soils and bedrock. Monitoring data collected by EPA, the State, and Denver indicate that volatile organic
compounds (including benzene, toluene, tetrachloroethylene, and chloroform) have migrated from the
trenches into shallow and bedrock ground water. The shallow contaminated plume extends at least 1 mile
past the disposal areas.
 
EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
In June 1983, under CERCLA Section 106, EPA ordered Denver to control and treat the contaminated
shallow ground water.
 
Status (June 1984) : Pursuant to an Administrative Order on Consent under CERCLA 106 issued in
January 1984, Denver is constructing a compacted clay barrier and a carbon adsorption treatment system.
They are scheduled to be completed in July 1984.
 
The remedial investigation/feasibility study is underway.
