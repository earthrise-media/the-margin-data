NPL Site Narrative for Maywood Chemical
Co.
 
MAYWOOD CHEMICAL CO.
Maywood, Rochelle Park, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Maywood Chemical Co. Site consists of three areas in
Maywood and Rochelle Park, New Jersey. Starting in the early 1920s, Maywood Chemical processed
radioactive thorium for, among other things, the production of mantles in gas lanterns. The process
resulted in thorium waste that, while known to be radioactive, was not considered particularly dangerous at
that time. The material was used as a fill in three areas now used for residential and commercial purposes.
Testing by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the State indicates that some areas show
radiation levels above background. Radon gas is present at levels significantly higher than background in a
home built in the residential neighborhood.
 
Status (July 1983) : An EPA investigation is underway to determine the extent of contamination at areas
not addressed previously by the State or NRC. EPA is also preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan which
will assess all existing information and guide further actions at the site.
