NPL Site Narrative for Del Norte Pesticide
Storage
 
DEL NORTE PESTICIDE STORAGE
Crescent City, California
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The County of Del Norte owns land south of the county airport
approximately 1 mile northwest of Crescent City, California. Portions of the land are occupied by county
office buildings. In the early 1970s, an area about 150 by 200 feet was fenced to provide a collection
site for a coordinated county-wide program for the interim storage of empty pesticide drums. The drums
had contained pesticides, including dichloropropenes, dichloropropanes, 2,4-D, and 2,4,5-T. The county
removed about 1,500 drums in January 1982. Sampling by the State has confirmed the presence of 1,2-
dichloropropane, 2,4-D, and 2,4,5-T in the ground water at levels that equal or exceed the suggested
maximum contaminant levels for these compounds. To date, there has been no evidence that off-site
residential wells have been contaminated.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the nature,
cause, and extent of contamination at the site and to identify alternatives for remedial actions.
