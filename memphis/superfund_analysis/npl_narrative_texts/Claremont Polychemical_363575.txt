NPL Site Narrative for Claremont
Polychemical
 
CLAREMONT POLYCHEMICAL
Old Bethpage, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Claremont Polychemical produced materials for coloring
plastic in Old Bethpage, Nassau County, New York, from August 1966 through October 1980. The site
consists of a 1-story building covering 40,000 square feet situated on an 8-acre lot. On March 13, 1975,
the State issued a Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit to the company. In November 1975, the
Nassau County Department of Health (NCDH) inspected the site and found approximately 1,500 drums
scattered about, some uncovered and others leaking or lying on their sides. The drums contained inks,
polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride resins, and organic solvents.
 
From May to September 1980, the company sorted and removed drums from the site. An inspection by
NCDH on September 26, 1980, revealed the soil was contaminated with inks and solvents. NCDH directed
Claremont to excavate contaminated soils. On October 27, 1980, counsel to Claremont told NCDH that the
company was in receivership and that funds for the cleanup were no longer available. Conditions have not
changed since October 1980. In August 1984, the State and the company signed an Administrative Order
on Consent requiring the company to undertake a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
About 47,000 people draw drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site. The nearest public supply
well is 3,500 feet northwest of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The measures called for by the August 1984 order are underway.
