NPL Site Narrative for Munisport Landfill
 
MUNISPORT LANDFILL
North Miami, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Munisport Landfill covers 291 acres in North Miami, Florida.
Between 1974 and 1980, it was operated as a sanitary landfill by a lessee of the City of North Miami.
During these years, it may have received hazardous wastes. EPA found low concentrations of various
organic pollutants in leachate from the site, and elevated levels of lead in several perimeter monitoring
wells. The site is close to two public well fields and to Biscayne Bay, which is part of Florida's water quality
improvement program and is also designated by the Federal Government as a critical habitat for the
Florida Manatee.
 
Status (July 1983) : In June 1983, EPA, the State, and County visited the site to assess the need for EPA
to start a sampling program at the end of summer.
