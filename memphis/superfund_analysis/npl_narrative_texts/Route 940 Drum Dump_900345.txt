NPL Site Narrative for Route 940 Drum
Dump
 
ROUTE 940 DRUM DUMP
Pocono Summit, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Route 940 Drum Dump covers 2.5 acres on Route
940 in Pocono Summit, Tobyanna Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania. During the 1970s, as many
as 600 drums of unknown materials were stored on-site. In early 1983, the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources (PA DER) was informed that some drums may have been buried on-site. Later
in 1983, PA DER detected organic chemicals, including xylenes, benzene, toluene, and chlorobenzene, in
on-site soils.
 
The site owner, Landmark International, Inc., has hired a consultant to assist in investigating the site and
developing a plan for remedial action. As part of the investigation, monitoring wells have been installed and
sampled, and about 100 drums have been excavated under PA DER supervision.
 
Several organic chemicals have been detected in on-site ground water in tests conducted by Landmark's
consultant. About 4,200 people depend on private wells and small public wells within 3 miles of the site as
their sole source of drinking water.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : PA DER continues to oversee excavation activities of the site owner and is in
the process of determining the studies required to complete a remedial investigation/feasibility study to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
