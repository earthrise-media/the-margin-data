NPL Site Narrative for Sand Creek
Industrial
 
SAND CREEK INDUSTRIAL
Commerce City, Colorado
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Sand Creek Industrial Site occupies more than 300 acres
in Commerce City, Colorado. Most of the site is industrially zoned and has supported a high volume of
chemical and petroleum production. The site includes the former Oriental Refinery, the 48th and Holly
Streets Landfill, the Colorado Organic Chemical Corp., acid waste disposal pits used by the L.C. Corp.,
and several small residences and businesses. The area has been the subject of health and environmental
concerns for the past 7 years. Investigations by the Tri-County District Health Department and the State
have linked ground water, surface water, and soil contamination at the site with the four major facilities
listed. The principal contaminants at the site include petroleum derivatives, sulfuric acid, and pesticides. In
June 1982, EPA completed a study to characterize the nature of this contamination. Surface water, ground
water, and soil samples were taken.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA's 1982 study showed the presence of inorganic contaminants (arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, nickel, and zinc) in a well and in Sand Creek almost due north of the well. The study also
showed that ground water is contaminated with various organic chemicals. The highest levels were found
near the old Oriental Refinery and downgradient of the landfill.
