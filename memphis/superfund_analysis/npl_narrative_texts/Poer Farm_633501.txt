NPL Site Narrative for Poer Farm
 
POER FARM
Hancock County, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 8, 1983) : Poer Farm covers 5 acres on a slight knoll between
two streams near Wilkinson in Hancock County, Indiana. In 1973-74, the site received and stored on
the ground 275 drums of paint wastes. The drums are leaking, and vegetation nearby is dead. EPA
analyzed the drums and soils and detected toluene, xylene, ethyl benzene, chromium, arsenic, and lead.
Ground water within 3 miles of the site provides drinking water for about 2,400 people. An on-site well is
contaminated by arsenic, cadmium, and lead.
 
In June 1983, EPA used about $100,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to alleviate the fire and explosion
hazard at the site. All of the drummed materials and contaminated soils were removed and properly
disposed of. The on-site well was resampled.
 
Status (September 21, 1984) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and to identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
Status (February 11, 1991) : This site is being deleted from the NPL because EPA, in consultation with
the State of Indiana, has determined that all appropriate Superfund-financed response under CERCLA has
been implemented, and that no further response by responsible parties is appropriate.
