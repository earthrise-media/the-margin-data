NPL Site Narrative for Velsicol Chemical
Corp. (Marshall Plant)
 
VELSICOL CHEMICAL CORP. (MARSHALL PLANT)
Marshall, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Velsicol Chemical Corp. Site covers 20 acres about 1 mile
north of Marshall, Clark County, Illinois. In the 1930s, the company built a plant there to produce resins. In
1946, the plant started to manufacture chlordane. In 1950, the company shut down its two resin units, but
continued to produce the pesticide.
 
In the early years of operation, process waste waters were discharged from the plant without treatment. In
1965, an injection well was installed for disposal of both waste water and storm run-off. A second well was
installed in 1973. These wells, under permit from the State, continue in operation. Part of the injection well
system consisted of surface impoundments known as Ponds 5/6, which are now inactive. These ponds
contain about 105,000 cubic yards of chlordane and sludge contaminated with hexachlorocyclopentadiene.
 
The surface impoundments have overflowed during heavy rain, and chlordane-related compounds have
been detected in a drainage ditch and two monitoring wells. Analyses of water from wells adjacent to the
impoundments strongly suggest that shallow ground water beneath the plant area is being polluted with
chlordane-related compounds. Mill Creek, its tributaries, and the Wabash River are similarly contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State and Velsicol are negotiating for the cleanup of Ponds 5/6.
