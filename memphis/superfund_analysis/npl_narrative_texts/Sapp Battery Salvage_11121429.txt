NPL Site Narrative for Sapp Battery
Salvage
 
SAPP BATTERY SALVAGE
Cottondale, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Sapp Battery Salvage recovered lead from spent lead-acid
batteries on a 30-acre site in a sparsely populated area between Alford and Cottondale, Florida, until it
closed in January 1980. Elevated levels of lead, zinc, and sulfuric acid have been detected in nearby
drainage culverts, Little Dry Creek, and Steele City Bay. Dead and discolored vegetation, as well as strong
sulfurous odors, has been noted along the drainage route from the site. Ground water pollution has not
been documented.
 
In August 1980, using $180,000 made available under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, EPA undertook
an emergency cleanup action, which resulted in a temporary restoration of pH levels similar to background
levels downstream from Sapp Battery Salvage.
 
Status (July 1983) : In August 1982, EPA awarded a $235,000 Cooperative Agreement to Florida for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of ground water contamination at the site and for
a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the
first quarter of 1984. EPA is also conducting a limited feasibility study (scheduled to be completed in the
third quarter of 1983) to identify alternatives for surface cleanup.
 
The State has filed a civil action suit to recover the costs of cleanup, damages incurred, and expenditures
made in the course of the activities.
