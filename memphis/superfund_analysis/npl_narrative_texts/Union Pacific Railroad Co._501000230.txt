NPL Site Narrative for Union Pacific
Railroad Co.
 
UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD CO.
Pocatello, Idaho
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : For an unknown number of years, Union Pacific Railroad Co.
has dumped sludge from its oil/water separation plant into what appears to be a 150-foot by 40-foot unlined
man-made pond, in Pocatello, Idaho. The 0.5-acre pond is just north of Union Pacific's West Pocatello
Railroad Yard, which covers a few hundred acres. For some time, Union Pacific has said it plans to
construct a sludge-thickening facility to replace the pond. Several years ago, Union Pacific also treated rail
ties, probably with pentachlorophenol (PCP), at an unknown location in the yard.
 
In 1980, the State sampled wells in the vicinity, detecting PCP in parts per trillion, and oils and grease in
parts per million (ppm). PCBs were not detected. In March 1983, EPA found 9 ppm PCP in the sludge
in the pond and 4.5 ppm in the liquid. These levels are considered a potential source of ground water
contamination, but to date no PCP has been found in drinking water samples. Samples collected at the
same time from private wells adjacent to the site were contaminated with PCBs. Additional information is
needed to further evaluate the yard's contribution, if any, to soil and ground water contamination.
 
Status (June 1984) : Any actions to be taken at this site will be coordinated with actions at Pacific Hide &
Fur Recycling Co., which is adjacent.
