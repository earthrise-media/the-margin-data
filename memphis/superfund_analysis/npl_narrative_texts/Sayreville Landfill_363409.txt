NPL Site Narrative for Sayreville Landfill
 
SAYREVILLE LANDFILL
Sayreville, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Sayreville Landfill covers 30 acres in a moderately
industrialized section of Sayreville, New Jersey. Part of this site is in a wetland adjacent to the South River.
The town owned and operated the site as a municipal landfill. The State excavated 30 drums from the
site and found that they contained para-ethyl toluene and pentachlorophenol. As many as 500 drums
containing similar chemicals may be buried on-site. Wastes from this site have contaminated surface water
and ground water. The Sayreville and Perth Amboy well fields, which serve about 65,000 people, are within
3 miles of the site. Perth Amboy has had to discontinue using some of its wells. Sayreville, however, has
not yet detected any contamination in its wells.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has included this site on its 4-year plan for cleanup of hazardous waste
sites.
