NPL Site Narrative for Waite Park Wells
 
WAITE PARK WELLS
Waite Park, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The municipal wells of Waite Park, Stearns County,
Minnesota, supply drinking water to 3,500 residents. The wells are contaminated with 1,1-dichloroethylene,
tetrachloroethylene, and other chlorinated solvents, according to analyses conducted by the Minnesota
Department of Health. Waite Park residents are temporarily obtaining drinking water from the St. Cloud
municipal system.
 
No one facility has been identified as the source of the contamination. From 1973 through 1978, Electric
Machinery and then Turbodyne dumped approximately 137,280 gallons of solvents, xylene, and other
chemicals into a pit in back of their property, according to records of the Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency (MPCA). The property is within 1 mile of the municipal wells. More solvents were dumped when
Brown Bavaria Turbomachinery purchased the property from Turbodyne in 1978. Later, Brown filled the pit,
placed pieces of concrete on the wastes, and landscaped the area.
 
MPCA is conducting a remedial investigation to define the extent and source of ground water
contamination and a feasibility study to select the most appropriate alternative for a long-term municipal
water supply.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : Activities continue on the remedial investigation.
