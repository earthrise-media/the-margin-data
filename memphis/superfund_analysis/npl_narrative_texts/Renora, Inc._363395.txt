Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Renora, Inc., a hazardous waste collector/hauler, operated
from a 5-acre site in Edison Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey, until the State revoked its permits
in November 1980. The site is bordered by Mill Creek, Conrail Railroad Tracks, New Jersey Turnpike,
and South Main Street. About 1,300 drums and 21 containers on-site contain solvents, resins, and oils.
Because of leaking drums and tank trucks, Mill Creek has been contaminated from site run-off. Access to
the site is controlled by a fence on three sides and parked trucks on the fourth.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has re-established an earthen berm along Mill Creek to prevent further
contamination from site run-off.
