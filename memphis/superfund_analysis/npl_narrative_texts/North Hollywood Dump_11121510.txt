NPL Site Narrative for North Hollywood
Dump
 
NORTH HOLLYWOOD DUMP
Memphis, Tennessee
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : North Hollywood Dump occupies 100 acres in the floodplain of the
Wolf River in Memphis, Tennessee. It received municipal and industrial wastes from 1930 to 1967, when
it was closed by the city. Pesticide-related compounds and heavy metals have been detected on the site.
Nearby soils and surface water are contaminated, and there is a potential for ground water contamination.
 
In March 1980, using $215,000 made available under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, EPA took
emergency action to reduce run-off from the site. In addition, a fence was put up and a monitoring program
started. In February 1981, the Technical Action Group (TAG), consisting of representatives from the State,
the City of Memphis, Shelby County, local industry, and EPA, removed some of the chemical wastes from
the surface.
 
In March 1981, EPA approved $184,000 for a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and to initially screen alternatives for remedial action. This amount was matched
by the non-Federal parties to IAG.
 
This is the top priority site in Tennessee.
 
Status (July 1983) : The remedial investigation is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983.
The next step, if approved, would be to decide the need for and select the cost-effective remedy.
