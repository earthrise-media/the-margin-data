NPL Site Narrative for Groveland Wells
 
GROVELAND WELLS
Groveland, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Groveland Production Wells #1 and #2 once were the sole
source of drinking water for Groveland, Essex County, Massachusetts. This site covers 850 acres and
includes the two municipal wells, the surface water and ground water that supply them, and the suspected
source(s) of contamination. In 1979, both wells were shut down when the State detected trichloroethylene
contamination. At this time, the town instituted emergency conservation measures and obtained water
through temporary hookups to neighboring communities. The backups were discontinued when the town
developed Well #3 along the Merrimack River, using an emergency grant from the Department of Housing
and Uuban Development. However, due to the lower yield of Well #3, the town continues its conservation
measures.
 
Status (July 1983) : The town's consulting firm has identified two likely sources of contamination of the
aquifer and municipal wells. Trichloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethylene, toluene, and
chloroform have been found in ground and surface waters throughout the study area. The town has filed
lawsuits against three companies involved with the two sites. One company has reached a settlement with
the town to investigate its property.
