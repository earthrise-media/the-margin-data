NPL Site Narrative for Pacific Hide & Fur
Recycling Co.
 
PACIFIC HIDE & FUR RECYCLING CO.
Pocatello, Idaho
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Pacific Hide & Fur Recycling Co. occupies about 10
acres near a residential area in Pocatello, Idaho. For several years prior to 1983, the company buried
PCB capacitors (previously there) and PCB oils from transformers on this property. In March 1983,
EPA conducted an emergency cleanup of the site at a cost of $350,000. A large number of buried PCB
capacitors were recovered and incinerated, and PCB contaminated soil was disposed of. The area where
the PCBs were found has been fenced. The site sits over an aquifer that feeds private drinking wells and
an industrial well of a nearby malt mill. Pocatello has seven drinking water wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
EPA made a preliminary survey of the entire site to assess PCB contamination of soils and collected
samples from nearby drinking and industrial wells.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is pursuing both civil and criminal enforcement actions against the company. A
criminal jury trial reached a guilty verdict against two of three defendants. Sentences were passed on June
29, 1984. Motions for discovery in the civil action for cost recovery have begun.
 
Any actions to be taken at this site will be coordinated with actions at the Union Pacific Railroad Co. Site,
which is adjacent.
