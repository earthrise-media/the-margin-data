NPL Site Narrative for Pioneer Sand Co.
 
PIONEER SAND CO.
Warrington, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Pioneer Sand Co. mines sand for commercial use in
Warrington, 5 miles west of Pensacola, Florida. The company owns a 20-acre inactive quarry into which
shredded auto parts, construction debris, and various industrial sludges and resins have been deposited.
Two surface impoundments are also located on the site. The State and EPA detected high levels of
chromium, lead, and nickel in on-site soils. High levels of chromium and lead were also detected in a
monitoring well installed by Pioneer Sand and in one of the surface impoundments. A well field for the City
of Pensacola (population 67,000) is within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1983, EPA performed a geophysical survey of the site. Draft results suggest
that ground water may be contaminated beneath the alleged disposal area. Further ground water
investigations will be conducted.
