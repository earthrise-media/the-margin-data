NPL Site Narrative for Highlands Acid Pit
 
HIGHLANDS ACID PIT
Highlands, Texas
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Highlands Acid Pit is located on the bank of the San Jacinto River
in Highlands, Harris County, Texas. The 18-acre site appears to be an excavated sand pit in which spent
sulfuric acid sludges from an unknown chemical process were dumped in the early 1950s. The highly acid
sludge contains heavy metals and organic chemicals. Strong odors emanate from the site during hot, dry
weather. Contaminants have been discovered in run-off, as well as in ground water at the site. The area is
subsiding, and portions of the property are under water.
 
Status (July 1983) : In September 1982, EPA awarded a $402,864 Cooperative Agreement to Texas for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of
1984.
