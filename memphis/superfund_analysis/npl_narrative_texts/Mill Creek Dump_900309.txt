NPL Site Narrative for Mill Creek Dump
 
MILL CREEK DUMP
Erie, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Mill Creek Dump operated on a 60-acre site in Erie,
Pennsylvania, from 1941 through 1981, when it was closed by the State because of illegal dumping
activities. Reportedly, 1,000 to 2,000 drums containing degreasers, foundry sands, furnace slag, oils, and
solvents are buried on the site. One portion of the site was once a 43-acre swamp that has been filled with
foundry sands and slag, which cover much of the area. The site is located in a commercial and residential
area immediately east of the Erie Airport. About 10,000 people live within 0.3 mile of the site, which is
unfenced.
 
Investigations conducted by EPA, the State, and the County Health Department have detected
contaminants, including heavy metals, solvents, and polynuclear hydrocarbons, in ground water, soil, and
Marshalls Run, a stream that is adjacent to the site and flows into Lake Erie. Two municipal wells about 0.3
mile upgradient of the site are not contaminated as yet.
 
Status (June 1984) : Late in 1983, EPA used $50,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to remove and
dispose of about 100 surface drums.
 
EPA has prepared a work plan for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
EPA is completing the initial phases of the remedial investigation. Well drilling and environmental sampling
are scheduled for mid-June 1984.
