NPL Site Narrative for National Starch &
Chemical Corp.
 
NATIONAL STARCH & CHEMICAL CORP.
Salisbury, North Carolina
 
 
Conditions at proposal (April 10, 1985) : National Starch & Chemical Corp. manufactures specialty
chemicals for the textile and furniture industries in two plants covering more than 465 acres in Salisbury,
Rowan County, North Carolina. The company purchased the land and a plant from Proctor Chemical Co. in
1969 and in 1970 started construction of another plant.
 
National Starch deposited about 350,000 gallons of liquid waste containing lead and various organic
chemicals in unlined trenches in a 2-acre area. According to tests conducted by the company's consultant,
ground water beneath the trench area is contaminated with lead, xylene, toluene, and other organic
chemicals. The plants are located in a rural area that depends heavily on wells for drinking water. About
7,700 people use public and private wells within 3 miles of the site for drinking water. The nearest well is
2,200 feet from the site.
 
From November 1980 until June 1983, the Proctor Chemical plant (National Starch kept this name for one
of the plants) had Interim Status under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
as a storer of hazardous waste. Interim Status was withdrawn in June 1982 after the company quit storing
hazardous waste on-site for over 90 days.
 
Status (June 24, 1988) : EPA is proposing to place this previously proposed RCRA site on the final NPL.
In June 1983, the Proctor Chemical facility was removed from the list of hazardous waste storage facilities,
and in November 1983, it was removed from the list of hazardous waste treatment facilities. The facility
now has generator-only status. Thus, the National Starch & Chemical Corp. Site satisfies a component of
EPA's NPL/RCRA policy.
 
On December 1, 1986, EPA and National Starch signed a Consent Order under CERCLA Section 106
calling for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the
site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA has placed this site on the NPL.
 
A Record of Decision was signed on September 30, 1988 documenting the remedy selected: the pumping
and treatment of contaminated ground water. The Unilateral Administrative Order covering the design and
implementation of the remedy was issued July 27, 1989.
