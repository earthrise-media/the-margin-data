NPL Site Narrative for Schuylkill Metals
Corp.
 
SCHUYLKILL METALS CORP.
Plant City, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Schulykill Metals Corp. recovers lead from storage batteries on
a 7-acre site in Plant City, Florida. Leachate containing heavy metals and sulfuric acid is migrating from
unlined impoundments into an adjacent drainage ditch that empties into Pemberton Creek. Monitoring
of ground and surface waters in the area has detected lead, chromium, and nickel, as well as ammonia,
which was used to neutralize the plant's acid waste water. Extremely high levels of lead were also found in
sediment in a downstream ditch draining to Pemberton Creek. EPA has determined that the pollution from
this site is from current operations subject to the authorities of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act of 1976 and not CERCLA.
 
Status (July 1983) : Schulykill Metals is now sending its neutralized waste water to the Plant City sewer
system.
