NPL Site Narrative for Burnt Fly Bog
 
BURNT FLY BOG
Marlboro Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Burnt Fly Bog is a semirural area covering approximately 1,700
acres, most of it in Marlboro Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. Some also extends into Middlesex
County. During the 1950s and early 1960s, as many as seven unlined lagoons on 10 acres within the bog
were used for storage, primarily of waste oil. As a result of both intentional and accidental discharges from
the lagoons, at least 60 acres of the bog have been contaminated. In addition to the contaminated area,
the site consists of: four lagoons -- two containing liquid, two containing sludge; an approximately 13,000-
cubic-yard mound of sludge; and an undetermined number of exposed and buried drums. The site is a
ground water discharge area for the Englishtown Aquifer. Ground water flows to the surface and drains into
Deep Run. Ground water, surface water, and air are contaminated by oil and various organic chemicals.
 
In September 1981, EPA awarded a Cooperative Agreement to New Jersey for $336,305 in grant funds
authorized under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
 
Status (July 1983) : Under the Cooperative Agreement, the State completed (1) a field investigation to
characterize ground water, (2) a feasibility study for removal of contaminated soil and drums, and (3)
a feasibility study for closing the site. Early in 1982, EPA used $35,000 of CERCLA emergency funds
to install a 900-foot fence and repair a 6-foot section of dike. EPA and the State are negotiating on two
Cooperative Agreements for further cleanup activities.
