NPL Site Narrative for Anchor Chemicals
 
ANCHOR CHEMICALS
Hicksville, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Anchor Chemicals has operated on a 0.9-acre site in
Hicksville, Nassau County, New York, since 1964. The facility blends and packs chemicals for the graphic
arts industry. In 1978, Anchor Chemicals was purchased by Chessco Industries. The new company is
known as AnchorLith Kem Ko.
 
Below the concrete floor of the building on the site are 17 storage tanks with capacities ranging from 1,000
to 2,000 gallons. A number of the tanks leaked during various pressure tests performed from 1981 through
January 1983 by the Nassau County fire marshall and AnchorLith Kem Ko.
 
The company has installed three monitoring wells at the site. Analyses by the company indicate that the
wells are contaminated with volatile organic chemicals similar to those contained at various times in the
storage tanks.
 
About 90,000 people draw drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
