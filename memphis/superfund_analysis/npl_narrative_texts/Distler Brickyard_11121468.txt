NPL Site Narrative for Distler Brickyard
 
DISTLER BRICKYARD
West Point, Kentucky
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Distler Brickyard Site covers about 35 acres in West Point,
Kentucky. It is an abandoned brick-manufacturing facility that was leased and used during the mid-1970s
for disposal of industrial wastes. Among wastes accepted were those characteristic of the paint and
coatings industries. In February 1982, EPA, using $300,000 in CERCLA emergency funds, removed all
drums and contaminated soil from the site. However, spills are suspected of contaminating ground water
beneath the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA conducted geophysical surveys and installed monitoring wells to better define the
extent of subsurface contamination. Also, EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining
the investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. EPA is planning a
remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and
identify alternatives for remedial action.
