NPL Site Narrative for Zanesville Well
Field
 
ZANESVILLE WELL FIELD
Zanesville, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Zanesville Well Field covers 1 acre northeast of Zanesville,
Ohio, on the east side of Muskingum River. It supplies water to the city. In late 1981, the State found
that 3 of the 13 production wells were highly contaminated. A ground water study conducted by EPA
identified trichloroethylene (TCE) as a primary contaminant; lesser concentrations of dichloroethylene and
chloroform were also present. The city took the three contaminated wells out of service and began flushing
to remove contaminants remaining in the water lines. By August 1982, the contaminated wells were still not
in use but were being continually pumped to reduce the contamination and prevent its further migration into
the well field. A nearby production well was also not in use because of the danger of contamination.
 
Status (July 1983) : The city is conducting a regular monitoring program at the site. A neighboring industry,
after studying its operations, began to excavate buried wastes and treat local ground water.
