NPL Site Narrative for Blosenski Landfill
 
BLOSENSKI LANDFILL
West Caln Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Blosenski Landfill, now inactive, covers 20 acres in West Caln
Township, outside of Coatesville, Pennsylvania. While in operation in the 1970s, the site, which is privately
owned, reportedly disposed of industrial and chemical wastes along with demolition and municipal wastes.
Sampling of on-site wells shows that trichloroethylene has entered ground water, along with other organic
and inorganic chemicals.
 
Status (July 1983) : Private wells were sampled in May 1983, and the results will show if contamination
has moved off-site. Pennsylvania has taken a number of enforcement actions against the landfill operator,
but the site has not been satisfactorily cleaned up.
 
EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. When the work is completed, EPA will negotiate
with the responsible parties regarding cleanup of the site.
