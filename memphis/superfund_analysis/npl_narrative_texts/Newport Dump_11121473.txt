NPL Site Narrative for Newport Dump
 
NEWPORT DUMP
Newport, Kentucky
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Newport Dump covers 40 acres in Newport, Kentucky. From
the late 1960s to 1978, the city owned and operated the site as a municipal landfill under a permit from the
State. In 1979, the city sold the site to the Northern Kentucky Port Authority. Under the agreement, the new
owner would be responsible for maintenance and proper closure. The authority entered into an Agreed
Order with the State outlining steps necessary for proper closure. Leachate analyses conducted in late
1979 revealed low levels of PCBs and some heavy metals. The city installed a leachate collection system,
but it was never operational. Contamination of ground water and surface water is suspected.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
