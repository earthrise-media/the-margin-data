NPL Site Narrative for Hidden Valley
Landfill (Thun Field)
 
HIDDEN VALLEY LANDFILL (THUN FIELD)
Pierce County, Washington
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Hidden Valley Landfill, located next to Thun Field, covers
about 75 acres near Puyallup in Pierce County, Washington. The area is sparsely populated, with
approximately 1,725 people residing within 1 mile of the site. Within the next 5 years, a developer plans to
build a 10,000-person residential community about 0.5 mile from the site.
 
From 1967 to 1983, the landfill, an old gravel pit, accepted liquid and solid waste. Approximately 48 acres
have been covered with waste. The landfill has no liner or leachate collection system. Originally, the landfill
was operated by Pierce County on leased land. Land Recovery, Inc. (LRI) purchased the property in 1977
and now operates the landfill.
 
In 1982, a consultant to the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department detected manganese in ground
water on the site. About 7,300 people are served by 35 public water supply systems drawing ground water
within 3 miles of the site. The nearest well is 1,000 feet from the site. Pierce County has petitioned EPA to
designate the Clover-Chambers Creek Aquifer underlying the site as a sole source aquifer under the Safe
Drinking Water Act.
 
A fresh water wetland is within 1 mile of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : In August 1987, LRI and the Washington Department of Ecology signed a
Consent Order requiring LRI to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. The study is expected to be
completed in early 1990.
