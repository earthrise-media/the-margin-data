Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Grand Traverse Overall Supply Site covers 1 acre in Greilickville,
Leelanau County, Michigan. Perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) were identified in nearby
shallow private wells serving residences and a school. PCE was also found in soils and water of an on-site
seepage lagoon, and in soil samples from inside and outside a dry well on the site. In 1977, cooling water
discharged to Cedar Lake Outlet also contained TCE. Later, process and cooling waters were discharged
to sanitary sewers. The wet well was excavated and new wells constructed for the school and residences
with contaminated wells.
 
Status (July 1983) : Conditions at this site are currently being addressed through an enforcement action
against parties responsible for wastes at the site.
