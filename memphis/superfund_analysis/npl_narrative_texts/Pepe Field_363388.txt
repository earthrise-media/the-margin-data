NPL Site Narrative for Pepe Field
 
PEPE FIELD
Boonton, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Pepe Field is a 3.5-acre municipal athletic field in a residential
area of Boonton, Morris County, New Jersey. The site, formerly a swamp, is suspected of having been a
hazardous waste dump. The nearby Rockaway River, which receives subsurface drainage from the site,
empties into the Boonton Reservoir, the source of Jersey City's water. Hazardous substances have been
detected in a below-ground drain that releases directly into the Rockaway River. Hydrogen sulfide and
other chemical odors are noticeable.
 
Status (July 1983) : The Town of Boonton is treating the odor problem at Pepe Field with hydrogen
peroxide, but with limited success. EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the
investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions
at the site.
