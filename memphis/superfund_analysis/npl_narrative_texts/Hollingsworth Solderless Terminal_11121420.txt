NPL Site Narrative for Hollingsworth
Solderless Terminal
 
HOLLINGSWORTH SOLDERLESS TERMINAL
Fort Lauderdale, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Hollingsworth Solderless Terminal Co. manufactures small,
solderless electrical connectors on a site of less than 1 acre in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the process, the
connectors are cut and forced out of copper sheets, annealed, degreased, and then electroplated with tin
or nickel. From about 1976 to 1981, Hollingsworth injected trichloroethylene, oil, grease, and dyes into a
100-foot-deep well on-site and discharged electroplating wastes into a large on-site drainfield. In addition,
wastes periodically entered the ground through spillage or other smaller drainfields. Several communities
in the vicinity of the site draw water from the shallow Biscayne Aquifer.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1982, Hollingsworth took several steps to correct the problem or characterize
the extent of contamination. The company pumped the injection well, installed 16 on-site monitoring
wells, sampled soil, conducted a ground water gradient study, and sampled public wells. Various levels of
contamination were found in some of the monitoring wells, water supply wells, and soil samples.
 
EPA recently prepared a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine the
full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
