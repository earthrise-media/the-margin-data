NPL Site Narrative for Juncos Landfill
 
JUNCOS LANDFILL
Juncos, Puerto Rico
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Juncos Landfill covers 2 acres in Juncos, Puerto Rico.
Thermometers containing mercury may have been dumped on the site, a closed municipal landfill. A small
underground fire is burning at the landfill. A small leachate seep and soil erosion were evident during two
site inspections. The site rises approximately 20 feet above grade. Of greatest concern is a new housing
development built over the landfill. Although most of the homes are not yet occupied, there is concern
about potential impact when they are occupied. The new community will be served from a public water
supply. Soil and air contain higher-than-background concentrations of mercury. No barriers exist to prevent
local residents or animals entering the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : In February 1983, EPA conducted field studies at the site to ascertain the health
hazard posed to local residents. Late in 1983, EPA plans to start a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining
the investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further
actions at the site.
