NPL Site Narrative for Northwest 58th
Street Landfill
 
NORTHWEST 58TH STREET LANDFILL
Hialeah, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Northwest 58th Street Landfill is a large, active municipal
landfill covering 1 square mile near Hialeah, Florida, along the east edge of the Everglades. Operated
continuously since 1952 by Dade County, this facility receives as much as 3,000 tons per day of municipal
solid waste. Leachate from the landfill has contaminated ground water with metals such as arsenic,
cadmium, chromium, and lead, as well as phenols and halogenated organic compounds. Two major public
water supply wells are located downgradient within 3 miles of the site.
 
To emphasize the threat to the regional water supply, this site, the Miami Drum Services Site, and the
Varsol Spill Site were collectively designated as the "Biscayne Aquifer Site" when they were first listed.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State has a civil suit pending against Dade County for failure to cease operations
by August 1981 (as required by a 1979 consent decree). The State and county are working together to
develop a final plan for closing the facility.
 
EPA recently completed a remedial investigation at this site as part of the area-wide "Biscayne Aquifer"
project. In January 1983, EPA approved $200,000 for a feasibility study of the aquifer. The work is
scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983.
