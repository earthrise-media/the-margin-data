NPL Site Narrative for Northwestern
States Portland Cement Co.
 
NORTHWESTERN STATES PORTLAND CEMENT CO.
Mason City, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. (NWSPC)
Site covers 150 acres in Mason City, Cerro Gordo County, Iowa. In 1950, NWSPC ceased limestone
mining operations and abandoned the quarry west of the plant. In about 1969, NWSPC began using the
West Quarry for disposal of cement kiln dust, continuing until April 1985. Over the years, the dumping
has reduced the area and volume of the West Quarry. During this same time, the water level has risen
approximately 2 feet per year, filling in the quarry so that it now holds approximately 420 million gallons of
water.
 
The waste kiln dust contains chromium and is very caustic (pH 12.4), according to tests conducted by the
Iowa Department of Water, Air, and Waste Management (IDWAWM) in October 1979 and August 1983.
Additional sampling by a consultant to NWSPC in September 1983 was consistent with earlier data.
 
Mason City municipal wells are within 3 miles of the site and serve a population of about 30,000. The
wells are drilled into the Jordan Aquifer but are open to overlying formations. The Devonian Aquifer, the
shallowest dependable source of water for many county residents, is one of the overlying formations.
Waste kiln dust has been deposited into this formation.
 
Calmus Creek, which borders the site downstream, shows high pH levels, according to tests conducted by
a consultant to the company in 1985. The creek is used for recreational activities.
 
On April 2, 1985, the State issued an Administrative Order under a State waste water law requiring the
company to cease discharge to Calmus Creek and conduct a study to determine the impact of the quarry
on ground water. The company submitted a report to the State dated August 12, 1985. The discharge to
Calmus Creek has been discontinued, and the ground water study is continuing.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : In March 1990, NWSPC, under a State order, completed a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action. A Record of Decision selecting the remedial alternative was signed on
June 26, 1990.
