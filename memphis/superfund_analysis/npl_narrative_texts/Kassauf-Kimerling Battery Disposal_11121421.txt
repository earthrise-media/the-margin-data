Battery Disposal
 
KASSAUF-KIMERLING BATTERY DISPOSAL
Tampa, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Kassauf-Kimerling Battery Disposal Site covers 1.5 acres
in Tampa, Florida. About 4 feet of battery casings from a local battery-cracking operation were used as
fill in a marshy area. High concentrations of lead were detected in surface waters near the site, and low
concentrations in on-site monitoring wells. An estimated 1,500 wells are within 3 miles of the site, and
surface drainage from the site runs toward a private fish farm and the nearby Palm River.
 
This site was originally listed under the name "Timber Lake Battery Disposal."
 
Status (July 1983) : In May 1983, EPA issued an order under Section 3013 of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act. It requires monitoring of ground water and surface water, analysis of the battery fill
material, and general soil sampling.
