NPL Site Narrative for Old City of York
Landfill
 
OLD CITY OF YORK LANDFILL
Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Old City of York Landfill covers 176 acres just outside Seven
Valleys, York County, Pennsylvania. The City of York owned and operated the landfill from 1961 to 1975.
In December 1981, EPA and State investigators found that the landfill was contaminating ground water
in the area with volatile organic compounds. The State then advised nearby residents with contaminated
wells to obtain alternate sources of drinking water or to treat their well water before drinking. The
investigations also found that leachate was flowing from the landfill into the nearby Codorus Creek, which
is used for fishing and other recreational activities.
 
In fall 1982, the State ordered the City of York to study the site in order to take remedial action. The city
appealed the order.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State and city are now negotiating an agreement for cleanup.
