NPL Site Narrative for Northwest
Transformer (South Harkness Street)
 
NORTHWEST TRANSFORMER (SOUTH HARKNESS STREET)
Everson, Washington
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Northwest Transformer started to refurbish and manufacture
transformers in 1958 on South Harkness Street, a mixed-use area of downtown Everson, Whatcom
County, Washington. The company transferred its storage and salvage operations from its Mission and
Pole Road salvage yard south of Everson to the downtown site after the salvage yard underwent an EPA
emergency removal in 1985 and was placed on the NPL in 1986. By 1987, the company had ceased
operations at South Harkness Street.
 
At the South Harkness Street Site, which covers less than 1 acre, Northwest Transformer stores
transformers, drums, and bulk tanks outdoors in an unpaved yard. A Washington Department of Ecology
inspection in December 1985 detected high levels of PCBs in on-site soils. Soils are permeable, and
the ground water is shallow (11.5 feet) in some places at the site. These conditions facilitate movement
of contaminants into ground water. Wells within 3 miles of the site are used by over 10,000 people for
drinking and for irrigation. Surface water from the area is used for irrigation.
 
Status (February 21, 1990) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
