NPL Site Narrative for Nyanza Chemical
Waste Dump
 
NYANZA CHEMICAL WASTE DUMP
Ashland, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Nyanza Chemical Waste Dump is adjacent to an active
industrial complex in Ashland, Massachusetts. The 35-acre site is within 1,000 feet of Sudbury Reservoir,
which is used for recreational purposes and is considered a possible supplemental source of drinking
water for the metropolitan Boston area. From 1917 to 1978, the site was occupied by numerous producers
of textile dyes and intermediates. Nyanza Chemical, the last of these companies, operated from 1965
to 1978, when it went out of business due to financial problems. Over 45,000 tons of chemical sludges
were generated by Nyanza's waste water treatment processes. Soil, ground water, and surface water are
contaminated with heavy metals and chlorinated organics. Mercury-laden particulates may also have been
blown into the air from exposed sludges.
 
The current owner leases the old plant to various businesses. When Nyanza sold the land, the court
required that about $250,000 be placed in escrow, most of which the owner has spent on site studies.
 
Status (July 1983) : In January 1983, EPA signed a $500,000 Superfund State Contract with
Massachusetts for a remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site
and a feasibility study to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in
the first quarter of 1984.
 
EPA has identified parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site and is seeking their
cooperation in the cleanup.
