NPL Site Narrative for Tansitor
Electronics, Inc.
 
TANSITOR ELECTRONICS, INC.
Bennington, Vermont
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Tansitor Electronics, Inc., manufactures electronic capacitors
on a 36-acre site in the mostly rural area of Bennington, Bennington County, Vermont. According to the
Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation (VT DEC), Tansitor disposed 117 drums of process
wastes, including 1,1,1-trichloroethane, acetone, n,n-dimethyl formamide, oils, and acid sludges, into
an unnamed perennial stream or directly onto the ground. In April 1984, VT DEC found that on-site soil,
surface water, and ground water were contaminated with silver, boron, and/or volatile organic compounds,
including 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethylene, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, and trichloroethylene.
 
An estimated 1,500 residents of Vermont and New York obtain drinking water from private wells within 3
miles of the site. Run-off from the disposal area, overflow from a contaminated pond, and process wastes
entered a perennial stream near the Tansitor property line. This stream joins Brown's Brook, which is used
for recreational activities within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : Tests conducted by the State and a consultant to Tansitor confirmed
contamination downgradient of the site.
 
In May 1989, EPA met with Tansitor to discuss the status of the site.
 
EPA emergency staff has collected water and sediment samples to help determine if a removal action is
warranted at this time.
