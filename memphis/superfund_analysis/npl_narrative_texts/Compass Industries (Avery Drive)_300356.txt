NPL Site Narrative for Compass Industries
(Avery Drive)
 
COMPASS INDUSTRIES (AVERY DRIVE)
Tulsa, Oklahoma
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Compass Industries (Avery Drive) Site (originally listed as
Compass Industries) is in an abandoned limestone quarry near the Arkansas River in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
From 1972 to 1976, the 108-acre site was owned and operated by Compass Industries. Although permitted
as a sanitary landfill, it may also have received an unknown quantity of hazardous wastes. Underground
fires are a problem at the facility. Liquid waste seeping to the surface at the landfill contains PCBs,
according to analyses conducted by the State. Surface run-off and possible ground water contamination
are concerns, as are air releases from the fires.
 
Status (June 1984) : The State and EPA are planning a Cooperative Agreement for a remedial
investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action.
