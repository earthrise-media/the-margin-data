NPL Site Narrative for Skinner Landfill
 
SKINNER LANDFILL
West Chester, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Skinner Landfill covers 85 acres in West Chester, Ohio,
on a ridge about 30 feet above the East Fork of Mill Creek. The privately owned facility, which was never
licensed, closed in the early 1970s. On-site are (1) about 100 drums containing a variety of chlorinated
organics, other organics, and heavy metals and (2) a lagoon once used to dispose of similar bulk wastes.
The owner indicated that old demolition bombs were also disposed of on-site.
 
Although no contaminants have been detected leaving the site at this time, the potential exists for
contamination of private drinking wells and surface water.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
