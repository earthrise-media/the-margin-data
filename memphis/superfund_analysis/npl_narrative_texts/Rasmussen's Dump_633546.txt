NPL Site Narrative for Rasmussen's Dump
 
RASMUSSEN'S DUMP
Green Oak Township, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Rasmussen's Dump occupies 5 acres in Green Oak Township,
Livingston County, Michigan. The owner buried an unknown number of drums of paint sludge and liquid
waste and also dumped liquid wastes directly into the ground. The dump was unable to meet State
licensing requirements and closed in 1974. Later, gravel mining removed the old fill material, uncovering
numerous drums. Soil near the drums showed high concentrations of PCBs, although contamination of
ground water or surface water has not been documented at this time.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
