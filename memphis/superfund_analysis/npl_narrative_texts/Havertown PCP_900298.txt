NPL Site Narrative for Havertown PCP
 
HAVERTOWN PCP
Haverford, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Havertown PCP Site is located in Haverford, Pennsylvania.
From 1947 to 1963, National Wood Preservers, Inc., disposed of waste liquids, primarily oil contaminated
with pentachlorophenol (PCP), in a well that drained into ground water below the plant. This waste liquid
eventually leached into Naylor's Run, a tributary of Cobbs Creek and the Delaware River. In 1976, EPA
took emergency action to contain the leaching.
 
In 1973, the State took legal action against National Wood and others in the area to require a cleanup of
the wastes. After seven years of litigation, the courts required National Wood to clean up the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State and National Wood are negotiating a schedule for removing the wastes.
Meanwhile, EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. If the State is unsuccessful in obtaining adequate
cleanup of the site, EPA will determine what additional measures are required.
