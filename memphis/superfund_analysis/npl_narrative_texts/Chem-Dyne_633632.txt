NPL Site Narrative for Chem-Dyne
 
CHEM-DYNE
Hamilton, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Chem-Dyne Corp. began operating a chemical waste transfer,
disposal, and storage facility on a 10-acre site in Hamilton, Ohio, in 1975. The facility handled a variety of
wastes, including pesticides, PCBs, polybrominated biphenyls, TRIS, lab packs, acids, resins, solvents,
heavy metals, and cyanides. Fires, explosions, and fish kills have occurred from the facility's operations.
Contamination of air, soil, surface water, and ground water has been documented.
 
In July 1979, a stipulation and judgment entry was filed in State court requiring, among other things, that
all material be removed from the site by July 1980. In February 1980, the State court appointed a receiver
to direct, manage, and control the assets and business activities of Chem-Dyne and to carry out the
stipulation.
 
In May 1980, EPA used $22,000 made available under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act to stabilize,
remove, and dispose of 17 potentially explosive drums. The State has spent $300,000 on site cleanup.
 
This is the top priority site in Ohio.
 
Status (July 1983) : In November 1981, the receiver informed the court that he lacked the funds to
eliminate the inventory, as required by the stipulation. In 1982, EPA approved $3.8 million for site cleanup,
part of it for a Superfund State Contract with Ohio to remove surface wastes, including 9,000 drums
and 200,000 gallons of liquid and solid waste in 33 storage tanks. On August 26, 1982, EPA reached a
settlement with 112 companies who had generated wastes on the site. They are contributing $2.4 million
to the surface cleanup, which is being managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and a study of
ground water, scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983. On the same day, the Department
of Justice, on behalf of EPA, brought a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief against the owners and
operators of Chem-Dyne, as well as the major waste generators who declined to participate in the cleanup.
 
The surface cleanup is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983. A remedial investigation
and feasibility study are underway to determine alternatives for cleanup of contaminated soil and ground
water. The work is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 1984.
