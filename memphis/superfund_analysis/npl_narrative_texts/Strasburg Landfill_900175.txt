NPL Site Narrative for Strasburg Landfill
 
STRASBURG LANDFILL
Newlin Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Strasburg Landfill covers 22 acres near Coatesville in western
Newlin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. In 1973, Strasburg Associates was formed and
purchased the site. In 1975, Strasburg Associates received a permit from the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Resources (PA DER) to accept municipal wastes.
 
During 1976-78, opening of the landfill was held up by problems between the company and West Bradford
Township concerning (1) use of "residentially zoned" roads, (2) proposed sale of the landfill to Strasburg
Landfill Associates, and (3) permitting of a proposed 200-acre expansion. Strasburg Landfill Associates
purchased the site in August 1978.
 
In February 1979, the 22-acre landfill opened under new PA DER permits for certain industrial wastes.
Between 500 and 600 tons of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) wastes were accepted at the landfill in 1979,
according to EPA. Several potentially responsible parties who disposed of waste in the landfill have been
identified.
 
PA DER fined Strasburg Landfill Associates $7,000 in December 1979 for causing excessive silting of Briar
Run Creek. In August 1980, PA DER permanently prohibited the landfill from receiving industrial wastes.
PA DER fined the company $53,025 in April 1983 for violations, including slopes in excess of allowed
limits, failure to cover compacted wastes, and inadequate sedimentation controls.
 
Later in 1983, PA DER found benzene, vinyl chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, copper, and lead in on-site
monitoring wells and various chlorinated organic compounds in an off-site private well downgradient of the
landfill. PA DER analyses identified the same contaminants in leachate from the landfill. About 800 people
draw drinking water from municipal wells within 3 miles of the landfill.
 
Brandywine Creek flows within 0.5 mile of the west and south sides of the landfill. Briar Run Creek, which
flows into Brandywine Creek, is within 300 feet of the eastern side.
 
In May 1983, PA DER suspended the operating permit, closing the landfill. Later in the year, the owner
regraded the landfill, covered it with 2 feet of soil topped by a plastic liner, stabilized the site, and planted
vegetation. In addition, a system was installed to collect leachate and store it in open 5,000-gallon tanks.
 
The site is not completely fenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact
with leachate in the open tanks.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is conducting a search to identify parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site and will then negotiate with them to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility
study to determine the type and extent of contamination and identify alternatives for remedial action.
