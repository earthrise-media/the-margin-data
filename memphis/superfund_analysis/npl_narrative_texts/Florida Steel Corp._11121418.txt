NPL Site Narrative for Florida Steel Corp.
 
FLORIDA STEEL CORP.
Indiantown, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Florida Steel Corp. Site occupies 150 acres in Indiantown,
Florida. The company used an electric furnace process to melt scrap metal and fabricate it into various
products. The site was closed for economic reasons in January 1982. The operations generated
emission control dust, which contains heavy metals and is listed as a hazardous waste by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act. Some of the dust was spread over the facility's roads, and about 75,000
cubic yards were deposited on the southern portion of the site in waste piles. In November 1980, Florida
Steel began to collect the dust in three baghouses and transport it to a chemical plant in South Carolina for
recovery of lead and zinc.
 
Florida Steel drew drinking water from an on-site well, and the Indiantown public water supply comes from
a group of shallow wells located within 3 miles of the site. Some local surface waters are used for irrigation.
 
Status (July 1983) : Results from EPA sampling indicate no violation of primary drinking water standards in
the area's drinking wells. The company studied the shallow aquifer downgradient from the waste piles and
found no violation of ground water standards. However, the State has requested the company to continue
to monitor on-site wells and to prepare a remedial plan addressing removal of the waste piles.
