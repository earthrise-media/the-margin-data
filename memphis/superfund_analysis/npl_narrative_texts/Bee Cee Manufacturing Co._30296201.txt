NPL Site Narrative for Bee Cee
Manufacturing Co.
 
BEE CEE MANUFACTURING CO.
Malden, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Bee Cee Manufacturing Co. formerly manufactured
aluminum storm windows and doors on a 1- to 3-acre site in the City of Malden Industrial Park located
in Malden, Dunklin County, Missouri. The company went bankrupt in 1983. Four shallow wells and two
deep wells in Malden supply drinking water for 11,500 people; one shallow well is approximately 1,000 feet
southwest of the site.
 
As part of its operations, Bee Cee discharged chromium-contaminated waste water onto the ground
without any treatment. An area approximately 50 feet by 100 feet is visibly affected, possibly as deep as 1
to 2 feet. Because local soil is sandy, contamination may have reached at least the shallow aquifer.
 
On July 27, 1981, the State advised Bee Cee that it was in violation of the Missouri Clean Water Law
because it was discharging a chromium-based waste water onto the ground without a permit. Bankruptcy
proceedings ended efforts by the State to have Bee Cee install a waste water treatment system.
 
Another company now leases the former Bee Cee building. The City of Malden is believed to own the
contaminated ground.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : A multisite cooperative agreement between EPA and the State covering five sites,
including Bee Cee Manufacturing, was approved on September 9, 1985. Initial funding is for planning
activities.
