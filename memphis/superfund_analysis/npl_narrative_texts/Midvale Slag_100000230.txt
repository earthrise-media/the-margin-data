NPL Site Narrative for Midvale Slag
 
MIDVALE SLAG
Midvale, Utah
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 10, 1986) : The Midvale Slag Site covers 300 acres in Midvale, Salt Lake
County, Utah. Midvale (population 10,000) is part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area (population
936,000). Between 1902 and 1971, United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Co. smelted ores on the
site to produce copper, gold, lead, and silver. The site consists of piles of slag estimated at 2 million tons
that remain from the smelting operations. The smelter no longer exists. In 1971, Valley Materials, Inc.,
acquired the site and processes the slag into materials for railroad beds and asphalt highways.
 
Testing by the Utah Department of Health indicated that the slag contains high concentrations of arsenic
and heavy metals. The slag is found on the surface and down to a depth of 20 feet. Hence there is a
potential for ground water contamination. Several municipal wells serving an estimated 440,000 people are
within 3 miles of the site.
 
The Jordan River, which forms the western boundary of the site, is not contaminated to date, according
to tests conducted by EPA in May 1985. However, slag piles are as close as 50 feet to the river, causing
concern that the river can become contaminated.
 
Status (February 11, 1991) : EPA emergency staff is fencing the site to prevent people and animals from
coming into direct contact with hazardous materials.
 
In mid-1991, EPA plans to start a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent
of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
