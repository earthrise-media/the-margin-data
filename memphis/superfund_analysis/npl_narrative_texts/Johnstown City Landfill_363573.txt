NPL Site Narrative for Johnstown City
Landfill
 
JOHNSTOWN CITY LANDFILL
Town of Johnstown, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Johnstown City Landfill covers 68 acres in the Town of
Johnstown, Fulton County, New York. After operating the site as an open dump from 1947 to 1960, the
City of Johnstown converted it to a sanitary landfill. The landfill is still owned and operated by the city.
 
The landfill accepted industrial waste from local tanneries until mid-1977. From 1973 to April 1979, about
20,000 cubic yards of sludge from the Gloversville-Johnstown sewage treatment plant were deposited in
piles in the landfill. The sludge contains high concentrations of chromium, lead, and iron.
 
EPA and the State have documented that monitoring wells and private wells in the immediate vicinity of
the site are contaminated with heavy metals. The City of Johnstown Well Field, approximately 4,500 feet
southeast of the landfill, is used only on an auxiliary basis because of high chloride, turbidity, and iron
attributed to the landfill.
 
The State is presently negotiating with the City of Johnstown for the closure of the landfill, additional
monitoring, and remedial action.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for this site.
