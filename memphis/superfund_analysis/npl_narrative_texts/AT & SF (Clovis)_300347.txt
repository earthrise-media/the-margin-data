NPL Site Narrative for AT & SF (Clovis)
 
AT & SF (CLOVIS)
Clovis, New Mexico
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway (AT&SF) has
conducted switchyard and car repair activities in Clovis, New Mexico, since the early 1900s. Activities
over the past 30 years have included washing of hopper cars and refueling of locomotives. Waste water
from the various operations discharges to a nearby playa lake, a potential source of contamination of the
underlying aquifer. In addition, diesel oil from fueling operations at the site has been found atop the aquifer,
which supplies drinking water to Clovis.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA has requested that the company determine the extent of contamination at the site
and develop any needed remedial program.
