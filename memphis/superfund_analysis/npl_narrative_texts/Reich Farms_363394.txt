REICH FARMS
Pleasant Plains, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Reich Farms Site covers 5 acres in the Pleasant Plains
section of Dover Township, Ocean County, New Jersey, about 3 miles north of Toms River. As a result of
improper storage and disposal of various hazardous substances -- including organic solvents, still bottoms,
and residual chemicals in 55-gallon drums -- both on the surface and buried, soil and ground water are
contaminated with toxic and volatile organics. The area is rural with suburban developments. It sits above
the Cohansey Aquifer, a major source of drinking water for 61,000 people in Dover Township and the
surrounding area.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
