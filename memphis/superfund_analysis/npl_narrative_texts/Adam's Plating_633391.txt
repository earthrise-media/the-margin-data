NPL Site Narrative for Adam's Plating
 
ADAM'S PLATING
Lansing, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : Adam's Plating has conducted electroplating operations on a
1-acre site in a heavily populated area in Lansing, Ingham County, Michigan, since 1964. Before 1964, a
dry cleaner was on the site and stored solvents in underground tanks. During 1964-71, according to the
owner, chromium-containing plating wastes were discharged directly to an underground tile drainage field.
Subsequently, the wastes were stored in an underground tank, which was removed in the early 1980s.
 
In response to a call to the State's Pollution Emergency Alert System in January 1981, the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) inspected a residence at 510 North Grace, the second
residence to the south of Adam's Plating. MDNR found that waste water with a high chromium content (150
parts per million) was saturating soils and had entered the basement. It appeared that the waste water was
entering from a drain whose underground connecting pipe had been broken during recent construction in
the neighborhood. In 1981, MDNR found 1,1,1-trichloroethane (a dry cleaning solvent) and chromium in
soil on the Adam's site.
 
Soil in the area is permeable and ground water shallow (4 feet), conditions that facilitate movement of
contaminants into ground water. An estimated 185,600 people obtain drinking water from municipal wells
within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
