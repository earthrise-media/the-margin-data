NPL Site Narrative for Monsanto Corp.
(Augusta Plant)
 
MONSANTO CORP. (AUGUSTA PLANT)
Augusta, Georgia
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : From 1966 to 1974, Monsanto Corp. used two areas at its
Augusta, Georgia, plant to bury phosphoric acid sludge contaminated with approximately 5 percent
arsenic trisulfide. The two areas cover about 0.2 acre, are about 6 feet deep, and are covered by a
highly permeable gravel-base material. Landfill No. 1, active from 1966 to 1971, was used to dispose of
phosphoric acid sludge containing more than 700 pounds of arsenic. Landfill No. 2, active between 1972
and 1974, received primarily plastic drums of sludge containing some 800 pounds of arsenic.
 
In June 1979, Monsanto began collecting data from two monitoring wells, one downgradient from each
area. From June to November 1979, arsenic levels in the wells ranged from 51 to 165 parts per billion
(ppb). The drinking water standard for arsenic is 50 ppb.
 
There are two aquifers in the area: the shallow Cretaceous Aquifer and the deeper Tuscaloosa Aquifer,
which supplies most local drinking water. Most residents use private wells. Gracewood, about 2.5 miles
from the site, uses the Tuscaloosa Aquifer to supply its 1,500 residents. Water in the shallow aquifer
probably can move to the deeper aquifer because the two appear to be separated by layers of sand.
 
Status (June 1984) : In November 1983, Monsanto completed the removal of contaminated soil from both
areas. The State then collected soil samples from the excavated areas and found that arsenic, cobalt,
cadmium, barium, and lead are not present in toxic concentrations. In January 1984, after receiving State
approval, Monsanto backfilled the excavation. In April 1984, Monsanto expanded the monitoring well
system to include several new upgradient wells and began a monthly monitoring program.
