NPL Site Narrative for Nepera Chemical
Co., Inc.
 
NEPERA CHEMICAL CO., INC.
Maybrook, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Nepera Chemical Co., Inc., Site covers 23 acres
southwest of Maybrook, Orange County, New York. Between 1953 and 1968, Nepera used the site to
dispose of a portion of the industrial wastes generated by its plant in Harriman, New York. The plant
manufactured a variety of organic chemical compounds. In 1953, the State issued Nepera a "permit to
discharge sewage or wastes into the waters of the State." Waste disposal started with two lagoons and
expanded to six lagoons, each measuring 160 feet long, 70 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The discharge
started at 50,000 gallons per week and declined to about 7,000 gallons per week in 1967.
 
State inspections detected leakage from the lagoons in 1958 and 1960. Nepera and EPA detected
contaminants, including arsenic, copper, zinc, dichloromethane, and di-n-butylphthalate, in on-site test
wells.
 
Due to the State's continuing concern about proper containment of the waste and the threat to the
Maybrook Well Field 800 feet away, which served 2,500 people, Nepera discontinued operation of the
lagoons in 1968. The last lagoons were filled in 1974.
 
On August 17, 1984, the State entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with Nepera to conduct a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The results of the investigation are due shortly.
