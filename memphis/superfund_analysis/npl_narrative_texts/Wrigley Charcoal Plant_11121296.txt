NPL Site Narrative for Wrigley Charcoal
Plant
 
WRIGLEY CHARCOAL PLANT
Wrigley, Tennessee
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Wrigley Charcoal Plant Site occupies approximately 1
acre on Old Charcoal Road, Wrigley, Hickman County, Tennessee. From the late 1800s to the early
1960s, Wright Charcoal initially, and later a number of other companies, produced charcoal briquettes, iron
products, and wood alcohol on the site. After industrial activities ceased, the Tennessee Farmers Co-op
acquired the site and later sold a portion to an individual.
 
During an April 1985 inspection, the Tennessee Division of Solid Waste Management discovered pits
containing a tar-like substance, waste piles, and old drums. Leachate was entering the North Fork of Mill
Creek, which is adjacent to the site. The State in 1985 and EPA in 1986 detected toluene, benzenes, and
phenols in the waste and leachate. The Bon Aqua Utility District has a drinking water intake in Mill Creek
1.6 miles downstream of the site. The intake serves an estimated 5,500 people.
 
Soil at the site is moderately permeable and ground water is shallow (25 feet), conditions that facilitate
movement of contaminants into the ground water. An estimated 300 people obtain drinking water from
wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (March 31, 1989) : Using CERCLA emergency funds, EPA re-routed a stream to prevent leachate
from entering the North Fork of Mill Creek.
