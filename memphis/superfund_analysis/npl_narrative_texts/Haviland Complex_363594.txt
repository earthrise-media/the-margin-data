NPL Site Narrative for Haviland Complex
 
HAVILAND COMPLEX
Town of Hyde Park, New York
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Haviland Complex covers several blocks in the Town
of Hyde Park, Dutchess County, New York. The site consists of a group of apartments and a shopping
center with an old dry cleaner, a car wash, a laundromat, and offices. At least seven private wells nearby
and two Haviland Complex water supply wells serving about 2,000 people have been contaminated with
trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, vinyl chloride, chlorobenzenes, and other volatile organic chemicals,
according to tests conducted by the county. The shallow aquifer is contaminated, and the bedrock aquifer
is threatened. No alternate water supply is readily available.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. Homeowners in the
area are currently buying their own bottled water. The apartment complex has installed an aeration system
to remove volatile organic chemicals from its wells.
