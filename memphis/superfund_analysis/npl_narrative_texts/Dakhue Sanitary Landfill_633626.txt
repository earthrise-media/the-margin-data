NPL Site Narrative for Dakhue Sanitary
Landfill
 
DAKHUE SANITARY LANDFILL
Cannon Falls, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : Dakhue Sanitary Landfill covers 80 acres approximately
3.5 miles north of Cannon Falls in a rural agricultural area of Dakota County, Minnesota. Since 1971, the
owner has had a permit from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) to accept municipal wastes.
MPCA estimates that through 1986, 817,000 cubic yards of solid waste (primarily nonhazardous industrial
and municipal waste) have been disposed of at the landfill, which has no liner.
 
MPCA analyses in 1985 and 1987 of shallow monitoring wells on the site detected volatile organic
compounds, including 1,1-dichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, methylene chloride, cis-1,2-
dichloroethylene, and chloroform. The shallow ground water is used for drinking water by about 600
residents within 3 miles of the site and for irrigation of an estimated 6,500 acres. The nearest drinking
water well is about 1,200 feet from the site.
 
The area near the landfill consists of gently rolling hills with a gentle slope toward the south. Pine Creek is
1 mile south of the site, and Cannon River is nearly 3 miles to the south.
 
In May 1980, MPCA issued Dakhue Sanitary Landfill a Notice of Noncompliance for failure to comply with
established operating procedures and failure to submit water monitoring reports. In November 1984, MPCA
issued a Notice of Violation for failure to submit work required by the landfill permit. In June 1987, the
company declared bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Federal bankruptcy code.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : In the fall of 1989, MPCA installed four new monitoring wells -- three
downgradient and one upgradient of the landfill. A new erosion control system is nearing completion.
MPCA is preparing workplans for further investigations of ground water and for capping the landfill.
