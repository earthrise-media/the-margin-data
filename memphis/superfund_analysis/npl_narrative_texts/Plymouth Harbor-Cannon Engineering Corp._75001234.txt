NPL Site Narrative for Plymouth Harbor/
Cannon Engineering Corp.
 
PLYMOUTH HARBOR/CANNON ENGINEERING CORP.
Plymouth, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Plymouth Harbor/Cannon Engineering Corp. Site occupies
0.5 acre in an industrial park in Plymouth, Massachusetts. About 20 yards from the shores of Plymouth
Harbor are two above-ground 250,000-gallon tanks and one 500,000-gallon tank containing mixed
solvents and oily wastes. Several seams have leaked, contaminating soils around the tanks. Ground water
contamination could not be documented because there are no wells and numerous potential sources of
contamination. Officials of the industrial park have complained about odors. Major concerns center around
possible rupture of the tanks, which would contaminate both ground water and surface water. In addition,
the site poses a fire and explosion hazard.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. Actions proposed to safeguard the
harbor and the community include removal and proper disposal of the hazardous substances from the
tanks. Planning is underway on the next step, a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the
type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
