NPL Site Narrative for Dutchtown
Treatment Plant
 
DUTCHTOWN TREATMENT PLANT
Ascension Parish, Louisiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : The Dutchtown Treatment Plant Site covers 21.5 acres
near Dutchtown in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The owner reclaimed oil on the site from 1965 to January
1984. In 1979, the State contacted the owner, now deceased, concerning compliance of the site with the
State's hazardous waste requirements. He submitted a site closure plan in June 1982, but the plan was
not acceptable to the State. In January 1983, the State ordered the owner to stop unauthorized removal of
hazardous waste and in January 1984 declared the site abandoned.
 
A large holding pond on the site contains 300,000 gallons of oily wastes and 1,700 cubic yards of
sludge waste; 372 cubic yards of contaminated soil are also on the site. The wastes contain benzene,
ethylbenzene, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, and 1,1-dichloroethane, according to the Louisiana
Department of Environmental Quality. In 1984, the State took two emergency actions to prevent
overtopping of the holding pond.
 
Analyses conducted by the State in 1984 revealed that shallow ground water (30 feet) under the site is
contaminated with chloroform, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, and 1,1-dichloroethane. About 1,500 people
obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of this site. The wells are drilled to depths of 200-280 feet.
 
The site is 1 mile from coastal wetlands and 0.25 mile from fresh water wetlands in the Mississippi River
watershed.
 
In June 1986, EPA detected benzene, ethylbenzene, tetrachloroethylene, toluene, and vinyl chloride in the
air near the holding pond, posing the threat of fire and explosion. About 130 people live within 0.25 mile of
the site. Although the site is fenced, it is unguarded. Thus, people and animals can come into direct contact
with hazardous substances.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : In March 1987, under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, EPA removed oil spilled
from tanks, presumably by vandalism.
 
EPA is planning for a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of
contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
