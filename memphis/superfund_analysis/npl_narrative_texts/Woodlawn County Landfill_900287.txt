WOODLAWN COUNTY LANDFILL
Woodlawn, Maryland
 
 
Conditions at proposal (January 22, 1987) : Woodlawn County Landfill covers approximately 37 acres in
Woodlawn, Cecil County, Maryland. The county operated the site as a landfill from 1965 to January 1979,
when it was closed under State order. Prior to becoming a landfill, the property was a privately owned sand
and gravel quarry.
 
Cecil County filled two large quarrying pits with agricultural, municipal, and industrial wastes. The landfill
was open 24 hours a day until 1973. According to the State, Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. disposed of
783 tons of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sludge at the site. In the spring of 1981, Firestone capped the PVC
waste area. On-site monitoring wells contain vinyl chloride, benzene, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and lead,
according to tests conducted by the State and EPA.
 
An estimated 5,700 persons draw drinking water from public and private wells within 3 miles of the site.
The nearest, a private well, is within 400 feet of the landfill.
 
In May 1984, EPA detected toluene, tetrachloroethylene, and lead in stream sediments approximately 200
feet from the site. The stream, designated by the State as a trout stream, enters Basin Run about 2 miles
from the site.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA is conducting a search for individuals or companies potentially responsible for
wastes associated with the site and will send them notice letters informing them of their potential liability.
