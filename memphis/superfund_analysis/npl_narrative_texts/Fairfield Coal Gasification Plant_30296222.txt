NPL Site Narrative for Fairfield Coal
Gasification Plant
 
FAIRFIELD COAL GASIFICATION PLANT
Fairfield, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Fairfield Coal Gasification Plant occupies one city block
in Fairfield, Jefferson County, Iowa. It is bordered on the west by a residential area. Iowa Electric Light
and Power Co. (IELP) has owned the site since 1878. This company was known as Interstate Power Co.
from 1878 to 1917 and Iowa Electric Co. from 1917 to 1953, when it assumed its present name. During
1878-1950, the facility produced a commercial fuel substitute from coal. Since 1950, the site has served as
a maintenance garage.
 
The main wastes associated with coal gasification are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which
are found in coal tar, a by-product of gasification, and cyanide salts, which are found in iron oxide waste
produced during purification of the manufactured gas. Some of the coal tar was sold and some was buried
in on-site pits. Disposal methods for the iron-cyanide waste are not known, but it may also have been
dumped on-site.
 
In 1985, IELP consultants detected PAHs, including benzene, phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and
benzo(a)pyrene, in ground water near the site. In 1987, EPA confirmed the contamination. IELP conducted
quarterly sampling to monitor the spread of contamination. An estimated 1,100 people obtain drinking
water from private wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
An intermittent stream flowing from the site intersects Cedar Creek 2.9 miles downslope. The creek is used
for recreational activities.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : On March 31, 1989, EPA and IELP signed a CERCLA Administrative Order on
Consent requiring IELP to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type
and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. EPA has reviewed the
RI/FS report. IELP is revising the report to reflect EPA's comments.
