NPL Site Narrative for GEMS Landfill
 
GEMS LANDFILL
Gloucester Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : The Gloucester Environmental Management Services (GEMS) Landfill
covers 60 acres in Gloucester Township, Camden County, New Jersey. The landfill is now closed. The
land is owned by the township and was leased to GEMS. Although the site is zoned for industrial purposes,
the surrounding land is principally residential.
 
Organic solvents and other industrial chemicals were dumped into pits at the landfill between 1970 and
1974. These chemicals are presently contaminating ground water, surface water, and air. About 38,000
people live within 3 miles of the site; many are dependent on private wells. Leachate from the site is also
contaminating Holly Run Stream and Briar Lake.
 
Status (July 1983) : In February 1983, using $270,000 in CERCLA emergency funds, EPA removed
debris from the site, constructed a fence, and took other measures to prevent the wastes from coming in
contact with residents in the area. In summer 1983, EPA plans to start a $125,000 remedial investigation to
determine the type and extent of contamination at the site.
