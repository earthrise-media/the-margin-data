NPL Site Narrative for New Bedford Site
 
NEW BEDFORD SITE
New Bedford, Massachusetts
 
 
Conditions at listing (July 1982) : PCBs were used by two manufacturers of electrical capacitors located
in New Bedford, Massachusetts, over several decades until the late 1970s. As a result of poor disposal
practices, PCB contamination in the New Bedford area is widespread. The harbor is contaminated at least
6 miles from the upper Acushnet River to Buzzards Bay. Ambient air, surface water, ground water, soils,
sediments, and the food chain are contaminated, as well as industrial plant sites. Sullivan's Ledge and
the New Bedford Municipal Landfill, which contains an estimated 500,000 pounds of PCB waste, are also
contaminated.
 
In May 1982, EPA entered into Consent Agreements with two companies to address the PCB problem on
their properties.
 
This is the top priority site in Massachusetts.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations
needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. The next step, a remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action, is scheduled to begin in the summer of 1983.
