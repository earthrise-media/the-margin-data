KENTWOOD LANDFILL
Kentwood, Michigan
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Kentwood Landfill occupies 55 acres in Kentwood, Kent
County, Michigan. Until 1972, the site was used as an open dump. From 1972 until 1975, Kent County
operated the site as a municipal landfill. The landfill reportedly received unidentified hazardous wastes.
The county installed a leachate collection system, but maintenance problems led to contamination of
nearby Plaster Creek with leachate containing cyanide and heavy metals.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is preparing a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to
determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
