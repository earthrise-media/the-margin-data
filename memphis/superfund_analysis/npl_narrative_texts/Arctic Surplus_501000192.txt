NPL Site Narrative for Arctic Surplus
 
ARCTIC SURPLUS
Fairbanks, Alaska
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 26, 1989) : The Arctic Surplus Site covers 22 acres in the southeast
part of Fairbanks, Alaska. The site is bounded to the north by a residential subdivision, to the south by the
Alaska Railroad, to the west by Fort Wainwright, and to the east by low-density residential property. On-site
are a variety of buildings, storage trailers, and discarded military equipment.
 
Salvage operations at the site were conducted from 1946 to 1976 by a number of parties, including the
Department of Defense (DOD). Approximately 3,500 to 4,000 drums are visible on-site. They contain
unknown quantities of various oils, fuels, and chemicals; many drums are leaking. Other wastes on-site
include unknown quantities of asbestos rolls, batteries and battery acid that was drained onto the ground
during battery recycling activities, and ash piles from incineration of transformer casings.
 
In September 1988, contractors for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation conducted a
site inspection and detected significantly elevated levels of lead, zinc, PCBs, phenanthrene, pyrene, and
copper in on-site soils. Ground water beneath the site is shallow and contains elevated levels of lead and
zinc. Over 12,000 people obtain drinking water from wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
In May and June 1989, EPA emergency staff assessed the site to determine if a removal action was
warranted. An inventory showed that approximately 1,700 drums contained liquids or sludges, some
flammable or corrosive. Chlordane, a very toxic pesticide, was detected in soils at concentrations as high
as 320,000 parts per million.
 
EPA started a removal action in September 1989 to stabilize the site and to prevent unauthorized access.
Leaking drums were overpacked, loose asbestos was stabilized, and a chainlink fence was erected.
Additional activities are anticipated for the spring and summer of 1990.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : On April 17, 1990, EPA issued a CERCLA Consent Order to DOD to complete
the necessary removal activities at the site. A second consent order with DOD, issued on June 21, 1990,
calls for a removal action to address all surface and containerized contaminants. The work is scheduled
to be completed in two phases, from July 31 through October 15, 1990 and from June 1991 through
completion.
