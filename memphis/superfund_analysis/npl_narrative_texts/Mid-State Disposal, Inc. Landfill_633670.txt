NPL Site Narrative for Mid-State Disposal,
Inc. Landfill
 
MID-STATE DISPOSAL, INC. LANDFILL
Cleveland Township, Wisconsin
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Mid-State Disposal, Inc., Site covers about 160 acres in
Cleveland Township, Marathon County, Wisconsin. From 1971 to 1979, the company owned and operated
a landfill and three lagoons on the site; the area involved is about 30 acres. Between 1974 and 1976, the
company buried about 4,800 tons of asbestos wastes from a fire-door manufacturer in trenches where
ground water is shallow. The lagoons were used for disposal of significant amounts of paper mill sludges.
 
The site has a history of overflowing lagoons, run-off to surface water, and seepage. When the site closed,
the landfill areas were covered with a clay cap, graded, and seeded; the lagoons were covered with a
fabric liner and gravel layer; and a leachate collection system was installed. The system is overflowing, and
leachate continues to discharge from the site, according to inspections conducted by the State.
 
In 1975, the State issued an order requiring the company to properly close the landfill. In 1976, when the
company failed to comply, the State went to court. In 1983, the State terminated its legal action because
Mid-State had no assets.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA is conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
