NPL Site Narrative for Old Bethpage
Landfill
 
OLD BETHPAGE LANDFILL
Oyster Bay, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Old Bethpage Landfill covers 2 acres in Oyster Bay, Nassau
County, New York. It is inactive, but is within an active sanitary landfill complex. The area around the
site, with the exception of Bethpage State Park to the south, is fairly well developed with residences and
industrial facilities.
 
Oyster Bay began operating the Old Bethpage Landfill in 1957, primarily for disposing of incinerator
residue. In 1967, the town began accepting garbage and trash and allowing homeowners to dump trash.
From 1968 through 1978, liquid and solid industrial process wastes and damaged drums containing
organic residues were disposed of at the site. In 1978, Oyster Bay applied to the State for a permit to
operate a sanitary landfill. Since then, the only industrial waste disposed of at the landfill has been metal
hydroxide sludges. The exact location of the hazardous wastes is unknown because they were deposited
with other wastes throughout the landfill over 10 years.
 
There is no surface water near the site. There are several ground water recharge basins used to dispose
of scrubber water from incinerators. The site, as is all of Long Island, is located above the Magothy Aquifer,
which supplies many public wells.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA has prepared a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed
to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
