NPL Site Narrative for Jackson Township
Landfill
 
JACKSON TOWNSHIP LANDFILL
Jackson Township, New Jersey
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Jackson Township owned and operated a 12-acre landfill in
a semirural area within its boundaries in Ocean County, New Jersey. The township obtained the site,
originally a mining pit, from a local mining company in the early 1970s and filled it from 1972 until it closed
in 1980. In addition to accepting refuse and sewage for which it had a State permit, the landfill received
liquid hazardous waste. As a result, the underlying Cohansey Aquifer, which supplies water to area
residents, has been contaminated with various organic chemicals. Local officials condemned over 40
residential wells, and the State provides funding for an alternate water supply.
 
Status (July 1983) : The State is pursuing cleanup through enforcement action.
