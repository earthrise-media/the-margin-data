LASALLE ELECTRIC UTILITIES
La Salle, Illinois
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The LaSalle Electrical Utilities Site covers about 4 acres just
north of LaSalle, Illinois. From the late 1940s to late 1978, a factory used PCBs to manufacture capacitors.
The company reportedly used waste oils to control dust in the parking lot until 1969. More than 1,000 parts
per million PCBs remain in the soil throughout the site. Warning signs, a three-strand barbed wire fence,
and a gate have been installed around the site. In August 1982, EPA installed four on-site monitoring wells.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA recently completed a draft Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the
investigations needed to determine the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions
at the site.
