NPL Site Narrative for Western Sand &
Gravel
 
WESTERN SAND & GRAVEL
Burrillville, Rhode Island
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Western Sand & Gravel Site covers 20 acres in a rural
residential area in Burrillville, Rhode Island. Originally, it was a sand and gravel quarry. From 1975 to April
1979, various liquid wastes and sewage were dumped into 12 lagoons or pits concentrated on a hill that
slopes down to Tarkiln Brook. The soil is highly permeable. Organic chemicals infiltrated ground water and
are flowing into Tarkiln Brook. Some private wells show low levels of contamination.
 
The State closed the disposal operation because nearby residents complained of odors. The quarrying
operation continues. Early in 1980, the State started to remove and dispose of waste in the lagoons. In
March 1980, under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, EPA pumped and removed chemicals in four open
pits at a cost of about $575,000. This was supposed to remove all major sources of contamination. The
State, however, found evidence that some sludges may have been buried at the site and then contracted
for a hydrogeological study. These actions cost the State almost $300,000.
 
Status (July 1983) : In July 1982, EPA awarded a $292,000 Cooperative Agreement to Rhode Island for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of
1984. The next step, if approved, would be to select the cost-effective remedy and begin design activities.
 
EPA has identified parties potentially responsible for waste associated with the site and is seeking their
cooperation in the cleanup.
