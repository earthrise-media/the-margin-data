NPL Site Narrative for Reilly Tar &
Chemical Corp. (Dover Plant)
 
REILLY TAR & CHEMICAL CORP. (DOVER PLANT)
Dover, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at proposal (June 24, 1988) : The Reilly Tar & Chemical Corp. Site covers 4 acres in Dover,
Tuscarawas County, Ohio. The facility, which operated during 1932-56, included a coking plant and
foundry built on top of an area that had been filled with slag. The operations involved coal tar, including
creosote wastes, according to information Reilly provided to EPA.
 
Soil and monitoring wells installed by EPA show high levels of creosote constituents, including
naphthalene, fluoranthene, pyrene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and phenanthrene, according to EPA tests
conducted in 1985.
 
The site is located on the sand and gravel deposits of the Tuscarawas River basin. The aquifer in the
deposits is the sole source of drinking water for about 28,700 people served by the municipal water
systems of Dover and New Philadelphia. An additional 4,000 people obtain drinking water from private
wells within 3 miles of the site.
 
The site is not completely fenced, making it possible for people and animals to come into direct contact
with hazardous substances.
 
The property is presently owned by Shenango Foundry and is inactive.
 
Status (August 30, 1990) : The site was fenced in September 1988 under a Consent Order with EPA.
 
On May 18, 1990, Reilly Industries, Inc. (the new name of the company as of January 1, 1989) and EPA
signed a Consent Order requiring Reilly Industries to conduct an emergency response action at the site
involving removal of surficial coal tar materials. Work started May 21, 1990.
