NPL Site Narrative for Atlas Asbestos
Mine
 
ATLAS ASBESTOS MINE
Fresno County, California
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : The Atlas Asbestos Mine operated from 1963 to 1980 on a 16-
acre site about 19 miles northwest of Coalinga, Fresno County, California. The abandoned site consists
of the asbestos mine, a processing mill, support buildings, and extensive asbestos tailings. Drainage
from the site is directly downslope into White Creek, then into the Los Gatos Creek. Los Gatos Creek is a
tributary to the Arroyo Pasajero, a flood area along the California Aqueduct. During the rainy season, the
California State Department of Water Resources drains the Arroyo into the aqueduct. Analysis of water
in the aqueduct, conducted by the Southern California Metropolitan Water District and the Department of
Water Resources, indicates high concentrations of asbestos fibers.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA has conducted initial planning activities for this site. The purpose was to gather
and review existing data on the site, define areas of insufficient data, and define the scope of any remedial
investigation. The plan also examined what remedial actions would be necessary to respond to the release
or substantial threat of release of asbestos into the environment. Remedial investigation activities are being
formulated and are expected to begin soon.
