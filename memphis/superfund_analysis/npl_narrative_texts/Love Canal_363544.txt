NPL Site Narrative for Love Canal
 
LOVE CANAL
Niagara Falls, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : Love Canal is a 16-acre landfill in the southeast corner of the City
of Niagara Falls, New York, about 0.3 mile north of the Niagara River. In the 1890s, a canal was excavated
to provide hydroelectric power. Instead, it was later used by Hooker Electrochemical for disposal of over
21,000 tons of various chemical wastes. Dumping ceased in 1952, and in 1953 the disposal area was
covered and deeded to the Niagara Falls Board of Education. Extensive development occurred near the
site, including construction of an elementary school and numerous homes.
 
Problems with odors and residues, first reported at the site during the 1960s, increased in the 1970s as the
water table rose, bringing contaminated ground water to the surface. Studies indicate that numerous toxic
chemicals have migrated into surrounding areas. Run-off drains into the Niagara River at a point 2.8 miles
upstream of the intake tunnels for Niagara Falls' water treatment plant, which serves about 77,000 people.
At this discharge point, the river sediment has also become contaminated.
 
Between 1977 and 1980, New York State and the Federal government spent about $45 million at the site:
$30 million for relocation of residents and health testing, $11 million for environmental studies, and $4
million for a demonstration grant (under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act) to build a leachate
collection and treatment system.
 
Status (July 1983) : A study completed in 1982 recommended construction of a slurry wall and cap to
contain ground water in the site as the long-term solution.
 
In July 1982, EPA awarded a $6,995,000 Cooperative Agreement to New York for (1) construction of a
slurry wall and cap, (2) four feasibility studies, and (3) a long-term monitoring study to determine seasonal
variations in ground water levels and leaching. In September 1982, $892,800 was added to (1) demolish
the school, (2) install a synthetic membrane over a temporary clay cap, and (3) erect a fence. Construction
of the slurry wall and cap is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1983, and the feasibility
studies in the third quarter of 1983.
 
The Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, has brought a Federal civil action seeking injunctive relief
against parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
