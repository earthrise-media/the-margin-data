NPL Site Narrative for Vogel Paint & Wax
Co.
 
VOGEL PAINT & WAX CO.
Orange City, Iowa
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : Vogel Paint & Wax Co. used a 10-acre sand and gravel pit
for disposal of its paint and varnish production wastes. The pit, which the company owns, is located just
outside Orange City, Sioux County, Iowa.
 
From 1967 to 1979, the pit received paint wastes containing lead, cadmium, chromium, mercury,
toluene, xylene, and mineral spirits, which is a grade of naphtha. An estimated 43,000 gallons of organic
compounds (aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) and 6,000 pounds of mercury, lead, zinc, and chromium
have been disposed of at the site.
 
The company has detected wastes, particularly volatile organics (toluene, xylene, and mineral spirits), from
this site in off-site monitoring wells. About 3,200 people depend on wells within 3 miles of the site as a
source of drinking water.
 
The State has issued an Administrative Order requiring the company to take remedial actions. The
company has started to comply.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The company's consultant is conducting a remedial investigation to determine
the type and extent of contamination at the site. The company and consultant have met with EPA and the
State regarding requirements of the investigation under CERCLA and the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA has received Part B of a RCRA permit application and returned its comments
to the company. The Part B may be necessary to enable Vogel Paint to treat on-site waste from the
cleanup.
