NPL Site Narrative for American Creosote
Works (Pensacola Plant)
 
AMERICAN CREOSOTE WORKS (PENSACOLA PLANT)
Pensacola, Florida
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The American Creosote Works Site covers 1.5 acres in Pensacola,
Florida, about 0.3 mile north of where Bayou Chico and Pensacola Bay meet. The facility treated wood with
creosote and pentachlorophenol (PCP) from the early 1900s to late 1981 or early 1982. PCP-contaminated
waste water was discharged into two unlined 80,000-gallon percolation ponds. In February 1981, the
U.S. Geological Survey identified phenols in ground water associated with American Creosote Works. No
drinking supply wells are within the known zone of contamination.
 
Status (July 1983) : In March 1982, American Creosote sold all the equipment on-site and later filed for
bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. The State has negotiated a Consent Order
requiring American Creosote to restore the discharge areas and install on-site monitoring wells. The
company constructed higher berms around the ponds to prevent overflow during heavy rainfall.
 
EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine
the full extent of cleanup required at the site. EPA plans to fund (1) a $290,000 remedial investigation/
feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for
remedial action and (2) an $85,000 initial remedial measure involving fencing the site, posting warning
signs, reconstructing the berms, and controlling flooding from the waste ponds. The work is scheduled to
start in the third quarter of 1983.
