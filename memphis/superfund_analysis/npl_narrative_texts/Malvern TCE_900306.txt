NPL Site Narrative for Malvern TCE
 
MALVERN TCE
Malvern, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Malvern TCE Site occupies a 2-acre wooded area
in Malvern, Pennsylvania. From 1952 to 1976, drums of wastes contaminated with various organic
compounds, including PCBs, were dumped in pits on the site, which was owned by a solvent reclamation
plant that is still in operation. Soil in the pits is contaminated with the same chemicals, and ground water in
the area is contaminated with trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene.
 
Status (July 1983) : The owner of the solvent reclamation plant has provided carbon filters to residents
with contaminated wells, fenced the pits, and made plans to clean up the pits and ground water. The
work has fallen behind schedule, and EPA and the State are re-evaluating the situation to determine what
additional government action may be needed.
