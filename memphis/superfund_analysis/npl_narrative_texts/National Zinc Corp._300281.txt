NPL Site Narrative for National Zinc Corp.
 
NATIONAL ZINC CORP.
Bartlesville, Oklahoma
 
 
The National Zinc Corp. (NZC) site is located on a 135-acre property at 11th and Virginia Streets in
Bartlesville, Washington County, in northeastern Oklahoma. The Bartlesville area is primarily residential
including schools, day care centers, churches, playground parks, recreational areas, and business
properties.
 
NZC operated a zinc smelter on this site from 1907 to 1976, when it was acquired by the Zinc Corporation
of America. NZC was also known as National Zinc Co., Horsehead, Inc., and St. Joe Mineral.
 
The NZC smelter had no air emission controls, allowing emissions to be deposited downwind in various
areas in Bartlesville. According to 1992 EPA reports, lead and cadmium levels in the top 2 feet of soil are
greater than three times natural background levels. Although the extent of the area of contamination has
not been completely determined, it includes contaminated soils at two schools and three day care centers.
An estimated 1,700 students attend the school and day care centers, and 170 people work at the facilities.
