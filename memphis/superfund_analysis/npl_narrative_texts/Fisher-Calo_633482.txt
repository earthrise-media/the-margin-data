NPL Site Narrative for Fisher-Calo
 
FISHER-CALO
La Porte, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : Fisher-Calo Chemicals and Solvents Corp. (Fisher-Calo) has
reclaimed solvents on a 34-acre site near LaPorte, Indiana since late 1972. Wastes were buried on-site in
over 10,000 drums. As a result of spills, burial of drums and wastes, and a large fire in March 1978, ground
water became contaminated.
 
In July 1980, the Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, brought a Federal civil suit seeking injunctive
relief against the owner and operator for improper disposal of drummed waste. The drums were excavated
immediately prior to the suit. The company entered into a Consent Agreement on August 4, 1982,
to monitor quarterly to determine if contaminants, including 1,1-dichloroethene, trichloroethene, and
tetrachloroethene, have naturally dissipated to acceptable levels.
 
Status (July 1983) : Fisher-Calo is continuing to monitor three wells and report the results to EPA. After
four quarters of monitoring, EPA will determine if there is a need for further remedial action.
