STANDARD CHLORINE OF DELAWARE, INC.
Delaware City, Delaware
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : Standard Chlorine of Delaware, Inc., manufactures
chlorinated benzenes on a 46-acre site in Delaware City, New Castle County, Delaware. In September
1981, about 5,000 gallons of monochlorobenzene spilled from a railroad tanker car onto the Standard
Chlorine property. Subsequent testing by the company and the State has detected chlorobenzenes in on-
site soils, ground water underlying the site, and Red Lion Creek, which is about 1,000 feet north of the
site. Ground water within 3 miles of the site supplies private and public wells serving an estimated 152,000
people.
 
Standard Chlorine has retained a consultant to study the site and recommend remedial alternatives.
 
Status (July 22, 1987) : EPA's preliminary plan for fiscal year 1987 includes a remedial investigation/
feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify
alternatives for remedial action.
 
The State is negotiating with Standard Chlorine to conduct the RI/FS.
