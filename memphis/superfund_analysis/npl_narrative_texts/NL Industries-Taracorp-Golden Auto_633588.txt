NL INDUSTRIES/TARACORP/GOLDEN AUTO
St. Louis Park, Minnesota
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : National Lead (NL) Industries, Inc., operated a secondary lead
smelter on about 10 acres in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, from the 1930s to August 1979. NL sold a portion
of the site to Golden Auto Parts, Inc., in the early 1960s and the remainder to Taracorp, Inc., in August
1979. Large amounts of lead slag from the plant's early operations were buried in a part of the site later
occupied by Golden Auto Parts. Starting in June 1979, air monitoring conducted by the State revealed that
lead standards were frequently violated when the plant was in operation.
 
Status (July 1983) : In May 1982, Taracorp notified the State that it was permanently closing the smelter.
NL, Taracorp, and Golden Auto Parts are conducting investigations at the site to assess the impact of the
buried slag and lead emissions on area soils, surface water, and ground water.
