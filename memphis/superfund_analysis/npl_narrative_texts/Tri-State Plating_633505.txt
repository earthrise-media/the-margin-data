NPL Site Narrative for Tri-State Plating
 
TRI-STATE PLATING
Columbus, Indiana
 
 
Conditions at proposal (September 18, 1985) : The Tri-State Plating Site is on a lot measuring 100 by
100 feet in downtown Columbus, Bartholomew County, Indiana. Metal-plating operations were carried
out at the site for over 40 years. Earlier operations were known as Hull Industries and Plating Services,
Inc. The City of Columbus caused the facility to close in 1984 by blocking off the sewer and shutting off
the water after numerous violations of city code and one spill that severely damaged the city's sewage
treatment system.
 
Records of the Indiana State Board of Health indicate a small amount of soil was removed from the site
during 1983. Plating sludges and wastes were dumped outside the building and into the sewers in 1983
and 1984, according to the Indiana State Board of Health, City of Columbus Utilities, and Bartholomew
County Health Department.
 
Tests conducted in early 1983 by the Board of Health detected high levels of cadmium, chromium, cyanide,
nickel, zinc, copper, lead, and manganese in soil on-site, thus threatening ground water. The site is 800
feet southwest of a municipal well field that serves over 30,000 people. Haw Creek, the nearest downslope
surface water, is 800 feet to the east of the site and joins the East Fork of the White River (a recreational
fishing stream) within 2.5 miles of the facility. The surrounding area is a residential neighborhood with
some small businesses.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
