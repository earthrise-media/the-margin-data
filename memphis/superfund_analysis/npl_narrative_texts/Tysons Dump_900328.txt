NPL Site Narrative for Tysons Dump
 
TYSONS DUMP
Upper Merion Township, Pennsylvania
 
 
Conditions at listing (September 1983) : Tysons Dump is located near a residential area in Upper Merion
Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The privately owned site consists of seven unlined lagoons
covering about 5 acres. In the 1970s, it accepted sludges and liquid wastes, primarily chlorinated and
other organic solvents, and dumped them into the lagoons. Leachate from the site flows into the nearby
Schuylkill River, which provides drinking water to over 30,000 people in Norristown and other nearby
communities. The State detected organic compounds in the air, which pose a potential threat to the heavily
populated residential area nearby.
 
In March 1983, EPA used $235,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to fence the site and to construct a
leachate collection and treatment system. In August 1983, EPA prepared a remedial action plan for the
site.
 
Status (June 1984) : EPA has completed a remedial investigation and is now working on a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action at the site.
