NPL Site Narrative for Teledyne Wah
Chang
 
TELEDYNE WAH CHANG
Albany, Oregon
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Teledyne Wah Chang Site covers 100 acres in Albany,
Linn County, Oregon. The company is the largest producer in the Western world of zirconium and other
rare earth metals and alloys. Production began in 1957. Wastes have generally been disposed of on-
site. Process wastes contain a large volume of solids that contribute radiation, heavy metals (barium,
cadmium, chromium, and lead), and chlorinated solvents to ground water, surface water, and air. Radiation
off-site is generally below established limits. Until 1980, sludges were taken to unlined storage ponds on
company property adjacent to the Willamette River. In 1979, the plant added a process to reduce radiation
in sludges and waste water. Sludges now have lower levels of radiation than previously and are taken to
lined dewatering ponds about 1 mile from the plant.
 
Status (July 1983) : Wah Chang had requested permission from the State to cover the old storage ponds
to minimize percolation that could contribute to possible leachate into the Willamette. In January 1983,
the State drafted a permit indicating its preference for moving the sludges to another location on company
property farther from the river. This action has been appealed.
 
EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine
the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
