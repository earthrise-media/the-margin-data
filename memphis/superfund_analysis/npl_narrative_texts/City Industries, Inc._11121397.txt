NPL Site Narrative for City Industries, Inc.
 
CITY INDUSTRIES, INC.
Orlando, Florida
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The City Industries, Inc., Site covers 1 acre in Orlando,
Orange County, Florida. From 1971 to mid-August 1983, the company operated a recycling and
transferring facility on the site, handling a wide variety of chlorinated and nonchlorinated organic solvents,
paint/varnish wastes, acid and alkaline plating wastes, PCBs, and waste ink. According to EPA tests,
ground water, soils, and sediments are contaminated with heavy metals and volatile organic compounds.
 
The company abandoned the operation in mid-1983, informing the State that it lacked resources to
continue operations and leaving approximately 1,200 drums and 12,000 gallons of unknown liquids and
sludges in large tanks. In August and September 1983, the State funded a cleanup of the site; 41 tons
of drums were crushed and removed, and 65 truck and tanker loads of contaminants were disposed of
properly. The cost was $950,000.
 
In February 1984, EPA issued an Administrative Order under CERCLA Section 106(a) requiring City
Industries to clean sludge from holding tanks, remove contaminated soils, and treat contaminated ground
water. The company did not comply. In March through May 1984, using about $500,000 of CERCLA
emergency funds, EPA emptied, cut open, and cleaned the tanks, thus removing the threat of explosion
and further soil contamination. EPA used an incineration device to treat about 1,700 tons of contaminated
soil. The treated soil remains on the site.
 
In February 1984, the State filed a civil complaint against the landowner, operator, and four companies
associated with the operator. On April 24, 1984, the State held a meeting attended by generators
potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site.
 
The facility received Interim Status under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
(RCRA) when the company filed Part A of a permit application. The company filed Part B, but EPA denied
the application twice for a number of reasons, including the fact that the company did not meet RCRA
financial guarantee and waste analysis requirements. The company also failed to submit a closure plan.
EPA terminated Interim Status on July 27, 1983.
 
Status (June 1987) : The generators formed a steering committee comprising approximately 200
industries. The committee has worked with the State to investigate ground water contamination.
 
In August 1986, EPA issued Demand Letters to approximately 250 potentially responsible parties to
recover Federal money spent for the 1984 emergency action.
 
Status (June 24, 1988) : EPA is proposing to place this previously proposed RCRA site on the NPL
because it has lost Interim Status (and hence authority to operate) and has a history of unwillingness to
take corrective action. The owner/operator has failed to submit an acceptable Part B permit application and
to comply with Federal and State administrative orders. He has abandoned the site and stated that he is
financially unable to clean up the site.
 
Status (October 4, 1989) : EPA has placed the site on the NPL.
 
The State has completed a remedial investigation of the site. The generators' steering committee submitted
the feasibility study in December 1988 and revised it in June 1989. EPA and the State are now reviewing
the revised plan.
 
EPA has recovered most of the 1984 emergency action costs from the responsible parties.
