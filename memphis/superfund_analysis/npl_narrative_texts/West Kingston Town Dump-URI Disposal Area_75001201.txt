NPL Site Narrative for West Kingston
Town Dump/URI Disposal Area
 
WEST KINGSTON TOWN DUMP/URI DISPOSAL AREA
South Kingstown, Rhode Island
 
 
Conditions at Proposal (July 29, 1991) : The West Kingston Town Dump and the University of Rhode
Island (URI) Disposal Area occupy separate adjacent properties on Plains Road in South Kingstown,
Washington County, Rhode Island.
 
The West Kingston Town Dump, which comprises the southern portion of the site, is east of Plains Road,
0.4 mile north of the URI campus. The area has been referred to in the past as the "South Kingstown
Landfill #2" and the "West Kingston Landfill." From 1951 to 1978, the Town of South Kingstown operated
the solid waste dump on approximately 6.5 acres that had been part of a sand and gravel quarry since the
1930s. In the early 1950s, the Town of Narragansett and URI also began using the area for solid waste
disposal. The dump's operations were unregulated until a Rhode Island Department of Health (RI DOH)
inspection in 1967 noted that wastes accepted at the dump came from industrial, residential, commercial,
and institutional sources. Numerous operational violations were subsequently noted. In 1975, a study by
the URI Department of Civil Engineering and the Rhode Island Water Resources Board concluded that a
leachate plume beneath the landfill was contaminating ground water as far as 1,200 feet to the west of the
dump.
 
The 12-acre URI Disposal Area, which abuts the West Kingston Dump on the north, has also been referred
to as the "URI Gravel Bank" or the "Sherman Farm." URI used the area for solid waste disposal from 1945
to 1987. When the town dump closed in 1978, the area began to receive most of URI's wastes, including
small quantities of empty paint cans, oil containers, and pesticide containers. An inspection in 1987 by
the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RI DEM) found lab equipment, machinery,
closed drums, and old tanks buried on the site. In 1983-84, URI operated a transfer station on the property.
 
In November 1987, RI DEM instructed URI to remove exposed waste from the disposal areas. By
December 1987, URI had removed 159 tons of materials and transported them to regulated waste disposal
facilities. The most recent RI DEM inspections in September 1988 and January 1989 noted that URI was
still dumping solid waste, including lab equipment, concrete scraps, and partially filled drums.
 
In the fall of 1987, RI DOH detected 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, 1,2-
dichloroethene, and 1,1-dichloroethane in private wells near the site. Analysis of surface water
subsequently collected from the pond on-site detected some of the same volatile organic compounds.
In September 1989, EPA's analysis of samples from on-site monitoring wells detected various organic
and inorganic chemicals, including lead. Three major public wells within 4 miles supply drinking water to
approximately 15,800 persons. An additional 12,000 persons are supplied by private wells, the closest
approximately 1,000 feet to the northwest of the site. Three other private wells, located approximately 875
feet to the west, were closed in 1988 due to contamination by volatile organic compounds.
 
The site is located along the eastern side of the Chipuxet River valley drainage basin. Hundred Acre
Pond, part of the river, is approximately 1,500 feet west of the site. The river basin is a major ground water
resource.
 
Status (October 1992) : EPA is considering various alternatives for the site.
