BIO-ECOLOGY SYSTEMS, INC.
Grand Prairie, Texas
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Bio-Ecology Systems, Inc., Site covers 11.2 acres in a
floodplain in Grand Prairie, Dallas County, Texas. The site was used for incineration, chemical treatment,
biological oxidation of waste waters, and landfilling of solids resulting from treatment processes. The site
operated from June 1972 through June 1978, when Bio-Ecology filed bankruptcy. The State recovered
available assets from the company and spent them for a limited site closure. Wastes present at the site
include mixed oils, solvents, and ketones (all in tanks), in addition to buried chromium, cyanide, and heavy
metal sludges. Shallow ground water is contaminated.
 
Status (July 1983) : In April 1982, EPA awarded a $328,000 Cooperative Agreement to Texas for a
remedial investigation to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and a feasibility study
to identify alternatives for remedial action. In March 1983, EPA added $29,090 to the award. The work
is scheduled to be completed in the third quarter of 1983. EPA is also moving forward with plans for an
initial remedial measure at the site to remove the tanks. A Superfund State Contract for $200,000 is being
negotiated.
