NPL Site Narrative for Syntex Facility
 
SYNTEX FACILITY
Verona, Missouri
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : North Eastern Pharmaceutical and Chemical Co. produced
hexachlorophene (soap) from 1969 to 1972 in Verona, Missouri, at a site leased from Hoffman-Taff
Chemical Co. The facility was later acquired by Syntex Agribusiness, Inc. Dioxin was produced as a by-
product during the manufacturing of trichlorophenol, which was used to make hexachlorophene. Dioxin
residues were disposed of in several areas at the Verona facility. Fish taken from the Spring River, which
runs by the site, are contaminated with dioxin as far as 96 miles downstream. In August 1982, Syntex
signed a Consent Order with EPA under Section 3013 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
agreeing to study the disposal sites and the Spring River.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is reviewing the results of a monitoring study by Syntex and is currently in
negotiations with the company to undertake remedial actions under the terms of a Consent Order under
CERCLA Section 106.
