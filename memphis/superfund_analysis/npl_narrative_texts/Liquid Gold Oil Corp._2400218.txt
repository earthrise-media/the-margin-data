as a "waste oil pickup" business. It purchased used oil and resold it for uses such as fuel, lubricating
oil, and dust control. Several deteriorating buildings and 27 storage tanks of various sizes are on about
2 acres. Oily wastes found on the ground, as well as liquid wastes stored in the tanks, contain lead,
chromium, nickel, and phenols. The site is within 1,000 feet of the San Francisco Bay and overlies shallow
ground water, which has no known beneficial uses at present.

Southern Pacific in August 1983.
