NPL Site Narrative for Summit National
 
SUMMIT NATIONAL
Deerfield Township, Ohio
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Summitt National Site occupies 11 acres near Deerfield
Township, Portage County, Ohio. From late 1972 to March 1978, it incinerated liquid wastes from about
60 companies. When it closed, an estimated 16,000 drums and 300,000 gallons of wastes, including
flammable solvents, paint sludges, waste oil, and C-56 (a pesticide by-product), remained on-site. Run-off
from the facility threatened to contaminate the Berlin Reservoir, a backup water supply for Youngstown.
Ground water and soils were contaminated. In October 1980, under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act,
EPA spent $160,000 to remove material contaminated with C-56, which threatened the Berlin Reservoir.
Between February 1980 and January 1981, the State spent $788,000 to control on-site pollution and to
minimize public health hazards.
 
Status (July 1983) : In November 1981, the State reached a settlement with a number of potentially
responsible parties to finance a $2.4 million cleanup of the materials stored on the surface.
 
EPA recently completed a Remedial Action Master Plan outlining the investigations needed to determine
the full extent of cleanup required at the site. It will guide further actions at the site.
