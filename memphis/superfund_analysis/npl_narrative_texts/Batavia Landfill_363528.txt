NPL Site Narrative for Batavia Landfill
 
BATAVIA LANDFILL
Batavia, New York
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Batavia Landfill covers 21 acres near Batavia, Genesee
County, New York. It is owned and operated by the Town of Batavia. In the past, industrial wastes,
including magnesium sludges, chromium hydroxide sludges, spent solvents, and oils, were disposed of
at the site. Run-off from the site has been observed entering the Galloway Swamp, a protected wetland
adjacent to the site. Ground water appears to be the greatest concern due to the potential contamination of
an underlying aquifer which supplies drinking water to about 6,500 people within 3 miles of the site.
 
Status (July 1983) : EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and
extent of contamination at the site and to identify alternatives for remedial action.
