NEWSOM BROTHERS/OLD REICHHOLD CHEMICALS, INC.
Columbia, Mississippi
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc., Site
covers 80 acres in Columbia, Marion County, Mississippi. Since the 1940s, the site has been used by
several owners, including the present owner, Newsom Brothers, and a former owner/operator, Reichhold
Chemicals, Inc., for the manufacture of naval stores.
 
In March 1984, EPA used $160,000 in CERCLA emergency funds to remove approximately 500 drums
of chemical wastes. EPA's analyses of the drums detected elevated levels of phenols and chromium. An
unknown number of buried drums remain on the site. On-site soil is contaminated with organic chemicals.
To date, private wells in the immediate area are not contaminated.
 
Columbia's wells, which supply water to 11,500 people, are located approximately 1,250 feet from the site
and are less than 100 feet deep.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : EPA has completed a search for parties potentially responsible for wastes
associated with the site, identifying Newsom Brothers and Reichhold Chemicals, Inc. Both declined to take
part in a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action.
 
In November 1985, EPA obligated funds for the U.S. Corps of Engineers to select a contractor to perform
the RI/FS.
