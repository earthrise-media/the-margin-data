NPL Site Narrative for Arsenic Trioxide
Site
 
ARSENIC TRIOXIDE SITE
Lidgerwood, Rutland, Wyndmere, North Dakota
 
 
Conditions at listing (October 1981) : The Arsenic Trioxide Site covers 700 square miles in Sargent,
Richland, and Ransom Counties in southeastern North Dakota. Heavy grasshopper infestations in the
1930s resulted in large and repeated applications of arsenic-based poisons such as arsenic trioxide.
Dated or excess poisons were often buried near shallow aquifers, left unmarked in outbuildings, hauled
to open dumps, or thrown onto agriculturally unproductive lands. Arsenic levels exceeding the maximum
acceptable limit set by Federal drinking water standards were identified in the Lidgerwood city water
supply, as well as in numerous private wells on farms. Rutland and Wyndmere water supplies also contain
arsenic.
 
This is the top priority site in North Dakota.
 
Status (July 1983) : In August 1982, EPA awarded a $218,000 Cooperative Agreement to North Dakota
for a remedial investigation to determine the extent of arsenic contamination in ground water and soils. The
work is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 1984.
