NPL Site Narrative for Anaconda Co.
Smelter
 
ANACONDA CO. SMELTER
Anaconda, Montana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : The Anaconda Co. copper smelter covers 5,000 acres in
Anaconda, Montana. It operated from the late 1800s until it closed in September 1980. For the most part,
the wastes left on-site at closure still remain. The State and EPA are concerned over possible release of
hazardous substances, primarily heavy metals, from the smelter wastes into surface water, ground water,
and air.
 
Status (July 1983) : The Anaconda Co. voluntarily entered into an agreement with EPA and the State for a
study to identify and quantify hazardous materials at the smelter. The sampling and analysis of the results
have been completed by the parties to the agreement.
 
EPA is planning a remedial investigation/feasibility study to determine the type and extent of contamination
at the site and identify alternatives for remedial action. EPA is also negotiating with Anaconda to have the
company take interim remedial measures to stabilize conditions at the site.
