NPL Site Narrative for Milltown Reservoir
Sediments
 
MILLTOWN RESERVOIR SEDIMENTS
Milltown, Montana
 
 
Conditions at listing (December 1982) : In May 1981, Missoula County took routine samples from seven
drinking water wells in Milltown, Montana. Four showed levels of arsenic that exceed the Interim Primary
Drinking Water Standard. Subsequent analyses by the State confirmed that the four wells, serving a total
of 35 residences, were contaminated with up to 10 times the standard of 0.05 milligram of arsenic per liter
(mg/l). Residents were advised to seek alternate supplies of drinking water.
 
Possible sources of contamination are leachate from an abandoned landfill east of town or dissolution of
metals from mill tailings, the sediments deposited behind Milltown Dam located south and immediately
adjacent to the town and across the Clark Fork River. Analyses of these sediments show total recoverable
arsenic levels of up to 148 mg/l.
 
Status (July 1983) : In June 1983, EPA awarded the State $513,000 to conduct a remedial investigation to
determine the extent and sources of contamination at the site and a feasibility study to identify alternatives
for remedial action. The work is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 1985.
