NPL Site Narrative for North Cavalcade
Street
 
NORTH CAVALCADE STREET
Houston, Texas
 
 
Conditions at proposal (October 15, 1984) : The North Cavalcade Street Site covers approximately 23
acres in Houston, Harris County, Texas. The site is in an industrial area on the north side of Cavalcade
Street. Houston Creosote occupied the site from 1946 until the early 1960s, when the company ceased
operations. Based on a review of aerial photographs and a contamination survey, EPA concluded that
a filled-in creosote pit is located within the site. Contaminants at the site consist of polynuclear aromatic
compounds associated with creosote and pentachlorophenol, in addition to contaminants from metal wood-
treating (wolmanizing) processes. Analyses conducted by a consultant to the City of Houston indicate
that soils (both on and below the surface) and shallow ground water on the site are contaminated with
chrysene, fluoranthene, anthracene, and wood-treating metals.
 
About 10,000 people use wells within 3 miles of the site as a source of drinking water.
 
Status (June 10, 1986) : The parties potentially responsible for wastes associated with the site have
declined to conduct a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS). Consequently, EPA has undertaken
a RI/FS to determine the type and extent of contamination at the site and identify alternatives for remedial
actions. Field work began in November 1985 and was completed recently.
